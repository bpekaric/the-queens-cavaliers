# Weapons

While *The Queen's Cavaliers* is not entirely focused around combat,
it's still a swashbuckling game -- so swords, muskets, and cannons play
a role in the stories being told.

In game terms, there are three broad categories that weapons fall into:
dueling, aimed, and explosive.

**Dueling Weapon:** A weapon that can be used in close-quarters combat
with one or more of the Dueling (Lunge), Dueling (Riposte), Dueling
(Feint), or Defense (Parry) specialties. Examples are swords, knives,
quarterstaves, and pikes.

**Aimed Weapon:** A weapon that can be used at range with the Military
(Aim) specialty. These include crossbows, muskets, pistols, and some
thrown weapons.

**Explosive Weapon:** Unlike some aimed weapons which also use
blackpowder, such as flintlock pistols or muskets, aiming an explosive
weapon isn't the problem. It's preventing yourself from blowing up in
the process. To make an attack with explosives, you use the Science
(Blackpowder) specialty. This category includes cannons, grenades, and
bombs.

## Free Starting Weapon

When you create your character for *The Queen's Cavaliers*, you get a
free weapon in addition to any granted by your classes and any
additional weapons you might also buy. If you don't want a free weapon,
you can instead take a +1D6 Barter die.

You can pick from the following basic weapons:

 - **Cutlass** (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)
 - **Dagger** (Knife +1D6, Either Hand)
 - **Flintlock Pistol** (Pistol +1D6, Either Hand)
 - **Rapier** (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)
 - **Sabre** (Sword +1D6, Main Hand, Cavalry)
 - **Smallsword** (Sword +1D6, Either Hand)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Weapon Qualities

There are four qualities possessed by all weapons: the type of Weapon
Prowess needed to use it, the Weapon Die that can be added as an Item
Die to your dice pools, the number of Hands you need to use to attack
effectively with one, and the Specialties with which that weapon can be
used. Some weapons also possess Success Table Additions which give you
additional ways to spend success points when making certain kinds of
rolls with the weapon.

**Weapon Prowess:** Weapon Prowess is your knowledge of the basics of
how to attack and defend with that weapon. There are nine types of
Weapon Prowess: bow, cudgel, knife, musket, net, pistol, polearm, sword,
and whip. All player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* automatically
have Knife Prowess.

**Weapon Die:** You can add the Weapon Die to a Dice Pool as an Item Die
if you have the appropriate prowess for the weapon. If you lack prowess
in a weapon, you can still use the weapon -- you just don't get to add
the Weapon Die to your pool.

**Hands:** Some weapons can be used freely in either hand, others
require two hands to use, and some are just intended for main-hand use.
These are represented by the following weapon qualities:

 - **Main Hand:** This weapon can be used in one hand. You can have
    another weapon in your other hand, but it must be usable in Either
    Hand. 
  - **Either Hand:** This weapon also requires only one hand to use, but
    unlike a Main Hand weapon, you can wield one in each hand (known as
    "dual wielding") or as a secondary weapon with a Main Hand weapon in
    your primary hand.
  - **Both Hands:** You need both hands to use this weapon.

**Scale:** The scale of a weapon depends on the number of hands
required to use it. Unless stated otherwise, Main Hand weapons are
considered handheld scale, Either Hand weapons are pocket scale, and
Both Hand weapons are portable scale.

**Specialties:** These qualities list the specific specialties that can
be used with that weapon. If a specialty isn't listed, it's up to the MJ
whether it's possible to use the weapon that way, and what kind of Drop
penalty you'll receive; for example, using Parry with a musket or Aim
with a rapier could have pretty heavy penalties -- Drop 2 for the
musket, Drop 4 for the rapier.

  - **Aim:** Any attack with handheld weapons made at range uses the Aim
    specialty, from throwing a knife to firing a musket. If you have
    prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add its Weapon Die to
    your Aim roll as an Item Die.

  - **Block:** Defense (Block) allows the use of armor and general
    toughness to throw off the effects of an attack. It can be used to
    negate attacks from either Dueling or Aimed weapons. You add your
    armor's Armor Die to your Block roll as an Item Die if you have
    Armor Prowess in that item.

  - **Brawl:** Only a few Dueling weapons can be used as part of a
    Military (Brawl) attack or defense; Brawl usually doesn't use an
    Item Die of any kind. Brawl can be used to inflict Yield, to disarm
    or knock down an opponent, or to defend against a Brawl attack.

  - **Feint:** The primary use of Dueling (Feint) is to build Advantage
    during a fight through tricky maneuvering or a false attack to draw
    the your opponent off-guard. It can also inflict Yield or trigger a
    Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add
    its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die, although you can
    perform a Feint without a weapon also.

  - **Lunge:** A Lunge is a straightforward attack against an opponent
    using a Dueling weapon, usually by stabbing, chopping, slashing, or
    bashing. It's the best way to inflict either Yield or Wounds on your
    target. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, add its
    Weapon Die to your Lunge roll as an Item Die.

  - **Parry:** This specialty of the Defense skill can be used to negate
    incoming attacks from Dueling weapons, and if possible, trigger a
    Riposte. You need to have a weapon, improvised or otherwise, in your
    hand to attempt a Parry. If you have prowess in that weapon, add its
    Weapon Die to your Parry roll as an Item Die.

  - **Riposte:** Dueling (Riposte) is a triggered Dueling attack
    that you can use by spending success points from another specialty
    -- either Defense (Parry) or Dueling (Feint). A successful Riposte
    can inflict Yield or Wounds, or decrease your opponent's Advantage.
    The Defense (Parry) specialty cannot be used to defend against a
    Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add
    its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die.

**Success Table Additions:** Some weapons have additions to the success
tables for specific specialties, such as Knockdown or additional damage.
These are represented by the + notation for success points, such as
Lunge (+++: Unhorse).

## Dueling Weapons

Dueling weapons are, by definition, weapons that can be used with the
Dueling skill and its specialties -- Lunge, Riposte, Feint, and Defense
(Parry). Not all weapons can be used with all specialties, however.

**Dueling Weapon Prowess:** The types of Weapon Prowess used with
dueling weapons are:

  - **Cudgel Prowess:** Any Dueling weapon used to bludgeon someone is a
    cudgel.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Net Prowess:** A net can be used as a Dueling weapon, although
    it's much more common to see this in Ekalia than in Gallinea.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** A polearm is any long-hafted Dueling weapon,
    typically (but not always) with the Reach quality. 
  - **Sword Prowess:** A Dueling weapon with a blade and a hilt. The
    pointy end goes in the other guy.
  - **Whip Prowess:** Whips are usually used in one hand, and most have
    Reach.

**Dueling Weapon Qualities:** In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, dueling weapons could have two additional qualities.

  - **Cavalry:** A dueling weapon with the Cavalry quality must be
    used with your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding
    a mount, you can substitute the mount's Item Die for your Weapon Die
    against an unmounted opponent.
  - **Reach:** A dueling weapon with Reach can be used to attack into an
    adjacent area as well as your own.

**Success Table Additions for Dueling Weapons:** Some dueling weapons
have additions to the success tables for specific specialties, such as
Knockdown or additional damage. These are represented by the + notation
for success points after the specialty name, such as Lunge (+++:
Unhorse). On a success with a weapon possessing that quality, you could
spend 3 success points to knock your target off her horse.

  - **Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade or hilt. You can only
    do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or
    if you are performing a Parry yourself. A broken weapon is useless
    except as an improvised weapon.
  - **Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using
    to attack you or the weapon she's using to Parry your attack. (This
    can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to
    choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an
    adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Execute a Riposte:** You can make a Riposte attack. This is the
    only way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful
    use of a Specialty or weapon with this effect on its Success Table.
  - **Grab:** You can snag an item worn by your target as long as you
    can see it, the item is Handheld size or smaller, and it's not being
    held by your opponent. You get to choose if the item ends up on the
    ground in your Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Inflict 2 Wounds:** Your opponent takes two Wounds. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or
    in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can
    result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage.
    Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense
    rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up; standing up is a Drop 1
    combined action.
  - **Restrain:** You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon,
    holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1
    penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional
    Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to
    a maximum of Drop 4. Your opponent can escape by making a simple
    check against Standard Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon
    attack. On a success, your opponent can break your weapon, let it
    fall in their Area, or grab it themselves.
  - **Unhorse:** If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that
    mount and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them
    falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your
    mount can make a trample attack right now for free, if it has that
    quality. Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and
    defense rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up. Standing up is a
    Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3
    penalty.

### Availability of Dueling Weapons

As stated <a href="#anchor-wealth" class="xref-insection"></a>, to purchase any item you must roll
against a pool consisting of that item's availability and its cost.

Common dueling weapons are those which aren't hard at all to find any
settlement of decent size, and even in some smaller towns. Those are
listed in the following tables.

The availability of common weapons is almost always 1D0 in settlements
of any size. The exceptions are cutlass, rapier, sabre, and smallsword
-- the common swords -- in a small rural settlement. In such situations,
the availability increases to 1D6.

Table: Common Dueling Weapons

| Weapon       | Cost | Hands          | Weapon Die  | Specialties                         |
| :----------- | :--: | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Buckler      | D6   | Either         | Shield +1D8 | Parry, Block                        |
| Club         | D0   | Main           | Cudgel +1D6 | Lunge                               |
| Cutlass      | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Dagger       | D6   | Either         | Knife +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Aim   |
| Quarterstaff | D0   | Both           | Cudgel +1D6 | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Brawl |
| Rapier       | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Sabre        | D6   | Main (Cavalry) | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Feint                 |
| Smallsword   | D6   | Either         | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |


  - **Buckler:** A buckler is a small shield that can be strapped to your forearm, usually on your non-dominant hand. You can hold an item in that hand but trying to attack with that hand while wearing a buckler gives you a Drop 2 penalty on rolls using either the buckler or that weapon.
  - **Club:** A standard club is simply a piece of wood or metal that you can swing at someone. It's not very sophisticated, but then again, you can likely pick one up wherever you are at any given time.  
  - **Cutlass:** The favored weapon of buccaneers, pirates, and other sailors.
  - **Dagger:** A dagger is a large knife that can also be thrown using the Aim specialty.
  - **Quarterstaff:** A medium-sized pole wielded in both hands that can also be used in a Brawl dice pool as well.
  - **Rapier:** The most common type of Sword in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a sharp, pointy weapon that can be used for all types of fencing.
  - **Sabre:** A lighter and faster weapon, the sabre is designed to be used from horseback although it functions equally well when dismounted.
  - **Smallsword:** Effectively a smaller, lighter version of a rapier, a smallsword can be used in the same way -- or you could dual-wield two of them if you want.

Uncommon dueling weapons have an availability of 1D0 in a capital city,
1D6 in any other city, and 1D8 in villages and other rural areas. The
one exception is that a bullwhip always has an availability of
1D0.

Foreign Weapons

In addition to the common and uncommon dueling weapons listed in the
previous tables and aimed weapons later in this chapter, the nations
that comprise Elara and Ifran have their own weapons as well. These
national weapons are described <a href="#the-countries-of-elara" class="xref-inchapter"></a>
and <a href="#the-countries-of-ifran" class="xref-inchapter"></a>, 

  - **Albia:** claymore, dirk, longbow, tuck
  - **Ekalia:** brandestoc, cinquedea, hook prothesis
  - **Northern Ifran:** horsebow, jambiya, shamshir
  - **Ondala:** espada ropera, montante
  - **Talania:** koncerz, szabla
  - **Varendia:** colichedemarde, katzbalger, zweihander

The availability of foreign dueling weapons is the same as that of
uncommon weapons -- 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and
1D8 in villages -- at least, when you're in that foreign country.

For neighboring countries, the availability of foreign dueling weapons
is 1D6 in a capital city, 1D8 in any other city, and 1D12 in villages.
In far-distant countries, the availability increases to 1D8 in a capital
city, 1D12 in any other city, and unavailable in smaller settlements.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Aimed Weapons

An Aimed weapon is one that can be used with the Military (Aim)
specialty. Larger ranged weapons are usually explosive weapons and use
the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks.

**Aimed Weapon Prowess:** There are five types of weapon prowess that
are used with Aimed weapons. You can add the weapon's Item Die to the
dice pool when making an attack roll with Aim if you have the
appropriate weapon prowess.

  - **Bow Prowess:** Bows, including crossbows, use the Aim specialty to
    attack, and fire arrows or bolts.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Musket Prowess:** Muskets are an Aimed weapon with longer range
    than pistols, usually doing more damage and taking longer to reload.
  - **Pistol Prowess:** An Aimed pistol can be fired with one hand.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** Apart from their use as dueling weapons, some
    polearms -- namely, spears -- can be thrown with the Aim skill.

Aimed Weapon Qualities: In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, there are five that apply to Aimed weapons: the time needed to
reload, and the effectiveness of the weapon at close, short, medium, and
long ranges.

  - **Reload:** For Aimed weapons that require ammunition, the Reload
    quality indicates what kind of Drop penalty is imposed when
    combining the Reload action with another action. Most muskets have a
    Reload value of Drop 3, and pistols of Drop 2.
  - **Close** Range**:** The Close Range quality is the Drop penalty
    imposed when firing an Aimed weapon at a target within your own
    area. Larger weapons such as bows or muskets tend to have a Drop
    penalty at Close Range.
  - **Short** Range**:** A target that is one or two areas away is at
    Short Range. With very few exceptions, nearly all Aimed weapons have
    no Drop penalty at Short Range.
  - **Medium** Range**:** Medium Range is three or four areas. Most
    Aimed weapons have a Drop penalty at Medium Range. If a weapon
    doesn't have a listed Medium Range, it can't be used to effectively
    attack at that distance.
  - **Long Range:** At five or more areas distant, a target is at
    Long Range. All Aimed weapons that can be used at this distance have
    at least a Drop 1 penalty. If there is no Long Range listed for a
    weapon, it can't be used to attack at Long Range.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Maximum Range?

The tables below don't specify a maximum distance for long range. That's
because areas are an abstract representation of distance, not exact
measurements. Under ideal conditions, a weapon that has the long range
quality could reach 10 or more areas away, depending on how the areas
are set up for that encounter; in a crowded city street, the effective
range will be much lower.

Ultimately it's up to the MJ to decide what the maximum effective range
is for any weapon used at extreme long range, although usually not more
than 10 areas.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

| Weapon           | Cost | Hands          | Weapon Die   | Reload | Close  | Short  | Medium | Long   |

  - **Arbalest:** Also known as a heavy crossbow, the arbalest is harder to use than a common crossbow but packs a larger punch.
  - **Arquebus:** A smaller and lighter musket with shorter range and less firepower.
  - **Blunderbuss:** The flared barrel of this musket makes it easier to reload, but also reduces its effective range.
  - **Caliver:** Another type of musket that can reload faster without the reduced range of the blunderbuss, but with a smaller Weapon Die.
  - **Composite Bow:** A heavier bow with longer effective range and pull.  
  - **Crossbow:** The crossbow uses stored mechanical power to fire bolts, instead of relying upon personal muscle power as a normal bow does.
  - **Double Musket:** The primary advantage of this double-barreled musket is the ability to fire twice, once per barrel, without reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D12, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double musket with a Drop 3 action.
  - **Double Pistol:** Like the double musket, the double pistol allows one shot per barrel without having to reload. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D8, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double pistol with a Drop 2 action.
  - **Dragon:** This heavier version of a pistol is favored by cavalry -- especially Dragoons, who take their name from the use of this large pistol.
  - **Flintlock Musket:** This is a standard musket used by infantry throughout Elara.
  - **Flintlock Pistol:** A single-barrel pistol found all over Elara and Ifran.
  - **Hunting Bow:** This standard bow, also called a shortbow or flatbow, has been used for millennia in pretty much every nation.
  - **Rifled Musket:** With a rifled barrel to provide better accuracy at long range, this musket is the favored weapon of snipers.
  - **Thrown Dagger:** A dagger doesn't have be reloaded, but you take a Drop 1 penalty to draw it as you would with any other weapon -- and once it's thrown, you don't have it any more.
  - **Thrown Spear:** Like a dagger, a thrown spear must be drawn first but doesn't require ammunition.

#### Ammunition

Firing a musket or pistol uses a small amount of blackpowder and a
bullet, while a bow requires an arrow. 

However, in the *The Queen's
Cavaliers*, strict tracking of ammunition and powder doesn't contribute
to the swashbuckling adventure style of the genre. If you have an Aimed
weapon that has a Reload value, you're assumed to have enough powder,
bullets, or arrows to fire your weapon and reload it as many times as
necessary. 

This applies even if you use someone else's weapon, or a
weapon you just picked up -- you just don't track ammo for Aimed weapons
in *The Queen's Cavaliers*. Except, of course, for explosive weapons.

## Explosive Weapons

Unlike conventional weapons, which use Dueling or Military (Aim) rolls
for attack, explosive weapons affect an entire area and inflict damage
on every creature, object, or other target within that area.
