## Clothing

Charmweaving, is the practice of adding
specific dyes, trinkets, threads, and other magickal enhancements to
articles of clothing. These enhancements provide bonuses to specific
tasks. 

### Clothing Qualities

Articles of clothing have the following qualities:

**Worn On:** Each article of clothing is designed to be worn on a
specific part of your body -- head, shoulders, torso, hands, legs, or
feet. In general, you can wear only one item per location, although you
may be able to stack multiple cloaks on your shoulders under certain
circumstances -- check with your Gamemaster to be sure.

Items worn on the legs can't have charms woven into them. 

**Social Rank:** Some items are associated with certain social ranks.
This doesn't restrict what you can wear, regardless of your own social
rank, but it may affect how you and your outfit are seen by others. The
social rank of an article of clothing can be used as an availability die
in a purchase roll.

**Scale:** Articles of clothing are usually handheld scale when carried,
and don't contribute to encumbrance when worn if the optional system for
encumbrance is used. Items wrapped up in a box for gifting or transport
are one scale category higher, including the packaging.

The following table lists the most common types of clothes that are
found in Gallinea.

### Standard outfits

Many outfits just naturally go together. Every new character starts with
one or two standard outfits depending on her class and backstory. In
addition to sharing a common cost, outfits are all considered part of
the same social rank, regardless of the actual social rank of each
item.

Table: Standard Outfits

| Item                | Cost    | Includes                                                             |
| :------------------ | :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clockworker outfit  | 2D6     | Gearspring goggles, smock, breeches, craftsman's gloves, pantofles   |
| Corsair outfit      | 4D6     | Tricorne, doublet, soldier's gloves, pantaloons, boots               |
| Courtly outfit      | 3D6     | Hair ribbons, bodice, courtier's gloves, skirt, chopines             |
| Crafter outfit      | 2D6     | Artisan's beret, smock, breeches, craftsman's gloves, buckled shoes  |
| Military outfit     | 2D6     | Capotain, soldier's gloves, breeches, boots, tabard                  |
| Peasant outfit      | 1D6     | Shift, breeches, buckled shoes                                       |
| Physician outfit    | 3D6     | Plague mask, surgeon's gown, breeches, pantofles                     |
| Priest outfit       | 2D6     | Clerical skullcap, vestments, courtier's gloves, breeches, pantofles |
| Scholar's outfit    | 1D6+1D8 | Ornate stole, robes, breeches, poulaines                             |
| Swashbuckler outfit | 4D6     | Cavalier hat, doublet, soldier's gloves, breeches, boots, cloth cape |

**Clockworker outfit (Artisan 1D8):** This is worn while doing
mechanician work, and usually has a lot of extraneous pockets and loops
for tools and gears. The most notable feature is the set of gearspring
goggles, which give an item die bonus of Perceive +1D6 on visual checks.

**Corsair outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Worn by sailors and pirates around the
world, and by many would-be buccaneers, this outfit certainly captures
the look of the chic privateer.

**Courtly outfit (Noble 1D10):** Nobles, and those who must interact
with them, are known for their outlandishly ornate couture and finely
arranged coiffure.

**Crafter outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Similar to a clockworker outfit, a
crafter outfit is for doing productive work, be it artistic, magickal,
or smithing in content.

**Military outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Military outfits come with an
appropriate tabard from the correct military unit, noble house,
mercenary group, or city guard. For example, a veteran/constable may
have one tabard from the French army, and another from the Parisian
watch. Military outfits don't come with a torso item, to facilitate the
wearing of armor.

**Peasant outfit (Commoner 1D0):** Plain and practical, peasant outfits
can be found throughout Europe, and in nearly every social rank. As
they're easily patched, many peasant outfits are simply stitched
together from different types and colors of fabric. 

**Physician outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The notable feature of this outfit
is the large, vaguely bird-shaped mask used during surgery; the beak of
this mask contains herbs and cloth meant to filter out diseases. Most
physician outfits start out white in color, but quickly become stained
with crimson.

**Priest outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The traditional dress of clergy
varies by their rank within the church. 

**Scholar's outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Students and instructors at
universities, seminaries, officer schools, and other institutions of
higher learning are expected to dress in traditional scholarly robes
while teaching or attending classes. Outside of class, of course,
they're free to wear whatever they want.

**Swashbuckler outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The cavalier hat, the billowing
cape, the high boots -- anyone wearing this outfit cuts a dashing figure
indeed. While some such outfits are more sedate and refined, many look
are flamboyant to an excessive degree.

## (subchapter) Charmwoven Attire

*introduction needed*

### The Nine Laws of Fashion

Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also
made according to exacting standards known as the Nine Laws of
Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to
work at all\!

The First is the simplest Law:

#### The First Law: The Law of Couture

*"One's clothes must fit properly."*

It seems obvious at first -- clothing is meant to be worn and to fit
properly\! But it's also the most important. If your clothes aren't
sized correctly for you, none of the charms will function. In addition,
each off-size article of clothing you wear adds a Drop 1 penalty to
combat actions if it's too large or too small.

To ensure your clothes are properly sized, you can't just buy your
clothes off the rack; the people of France are a diverse group when it
comes to body size, and there are no "standard sizes". Your clothes will
need to be either be created specifically for you, or altered by a
tailor. Only then can charms be effectively added to such apparel.

#### The Second Law: The Law of Attunement

*"Charms are unique to the wearer."*

You can't just pick up any random charmwoven item and put it on, even if
it fits you. The patterns, glyphs, and trinkets sewn into charmwoven
clothing have to be calibrated for each wearers. This is a pretty simple
process -- as long as the charmweaver knows your birth date, birth time,
and place of birth. It usually takes about an hour to attune or reattune
charms to any given person.

What if you don't know some or any of that information to tell your
charmweaver? There are two options.

First, your charmweaver can attempt to adjust the charms to you anyway,
through trial and error. This takes one hour per piece of information
about your birth that you're missing. At the end of that process, the
charmweaver makes a simple Magicks (Weave) roll with the opposition pool
based on how much they don't know, as shown on the following
table.

Table: Opposition Pool for Charm Attunement Rolls

| Die | Birth Date           | Birth Time          | Place of Birth           |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| D0  | Exact date           | Time, to the minute | City or village of birth |
| D6  | Year and month known | Time, to the hour   | Province of birth        |
| D8  | Month known          | Morning or Night    | Country of birth         |
| D10 | Year known           | \--                 | Continent of birth       |
| D12 | Nothing known        | Nothing known       | Nothing known            |

The dice pool is based on all of these factors -- so if you know the
exact date of your birth, that you know you were born in the morning,
and that you were born somewhere in Russia, that's an opposition pool
of 1D0+1D8+1D8, or 2D8. As it's a simple check, the charmweaver needs
just one success point to correctly attune the item. On a failed check,
the charmweaver needs to start over again to attune the item.

The second option involves the use of Magicks (Portents), and for this
reason many charmweavers either work with those who can read omens, or
can do so themselves. 

The opposition pool for the Portents roll is the same as the pool
calculated above for the trial-and-error method using the Magicks
(Weave) specialty, but this is a standard roll not a simple roll. It
takes one minute to perform this type of reading, the portent-reader
must see you the entire time, and you must be willing to have it done.
Each success point spent reveals either your birth date, your birth time
to the minute, or your city or village of birth.

#### The Third Law: The Law of Pertinence

*"The charm must correspond to the article."*

Simply stated, this means that a charm can only be applied to an item
that has some relationship to the type of enchantment desired.

For example, gloves for soldiers can be given charms that assist with
Dueling or Military (Aim), while gloves for craftsmen can be charmed for
Magicks, Medicine, or Science.

Pertinent skills for any given type of clothing are found later in this
chapter, in the "Articles of Clothing" section. The "Creating Charmwoven
Clothing" section, also found in this chapter, summarizes which types of
charms can be applied to which pieces of attire.

#### The Fourth Law: The Law of Dissonance

*"Dissonance limits the effectiveness of charms."*

*description of dissonance needed*

| Dissonance Level | Maximum Charm Die |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 0                | No limits         |

#### Head Apparel

The people of France wear many different kinds of hats, with a type of headwear
available to every type of charm -- all the skills, with the exception
of Initiative. The types of hats available are shown in the following
table.

Table: Head Apparel

| Item                | Cost | Social Rank | Pertinent Skills                  |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |

**Beret, Artisan's:** The simple woolen beret is common among crafters,
and you can get a beret in many different colors.

**Capotain:** A capotain is a tall hat, usually flat on the top, with a
narrow brim.  Most capotains are black in color, and many sport buckles in front.

**Cavalier Hat:** Cavalier hats have a wide brim and are usually worn
with one side pinned up. A dyed ostrich feather is often added, both for
appearance's sake and to allow all-black hats to take a charm. 

**Goggles, Gearspring:** These goggles are created and used by
mechanicians as well as other crafters. Each set of goggles has two or
more pairs of lenses that can be swapped in as necessary -- functions
include magnification of small objects, telescopic sighting of distant
objects, filters for specific colors, or simple eye protection.
Gearspring goggles offer a +1D6 Item Die on Observation (Perception) rolls.

**Hair Ribbons:** Magickally charmed hair ribbons are popular with the
upper classes and are woven into the hairstyles -- or wigs -- of any
gender of noble. Unless affixed to a wig (which must be one of the
neutral colors of argent, brunâtre, cendree, or sable), the ribbons
require anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to weave into hair,
or double that time if forced to don them without the help of a capable
household servant.

**Masque:** Not a bandanna clumsily worn by a common brigand to disguise
her identity, a masque actually does little to hide one's appearance.
Used by the nobility at their lavish parties, each is custom created to
reflect the wearer's persona and opinions of herself. Many masques only
encircle the eyes and the space between them, while others cover the
entire face. 

**Plague Mask:** Part of a chirurgeon's standard surgical wear, a plague
mask is usually styled like a bird's long beak, although other examples
exist, such as long tusks or simply a cylinder. Goggles built into the
mask provide covering for the chirurgeon's eyes, while medicinal herbs
and complex filters in the "nose" cavity prevent infection of
air-carried diseases.

**Skullcap, Clerical:** Sometimes called calottes, these skullcaps are
associated with clergy.

**Tricorne:** These felt hats have wide brims like cavalier hats, but
are pinned up on the sides and backs, forming them into triangular
shapes.  Tricornes are most popular among sailors and members of
