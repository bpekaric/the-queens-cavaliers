# Wealth   {#anchor-wealth}

In *The Queen's Cavaliers*, money is treated as an abstract resource
rather than counting the exact number of Crowns, Sols, and Lunes that
your character is carrying. Your character's ability to purchase items
is represented by a composite Wealth pool, and goods or services are
rated by cost and availability.

## Wealth Pools

A Wealth score for a player character is a pool based on the following
dice:

  - The character's two Social Rank scores
  - The character's Competency Die

A new Duelist/Charmweaver character would thus have a Wealth dice pool
consisting of 1D6 (Soldier social rank), 1D8 (Artisan social rank), and
1D6 (starting Competency die), for a total of 1D8+2D6.

Wealth pools can become depleted by making successful Wealth rolls
during the course of a game session, as described below. At the start of
each session, a character's Wealth pool is restored to its original
value.

## Purchase Costs and Availability

Each item or service that you can buy has a cost, as shown on the
equipment lists. For example, a dagger is 1D0, a leather jerkin is 1D6,
and an airship is 4D12.

The availability of the item is dependent upon where you are and how
common the item is, as determined by the MJ based on the following
table.

Table: Availability

| Availability | Die | Skill Required |
| ------------ | --- | -------------- |
| Very Common  | D0  | Apprentice     |
| Common       | D6  | Journeyman     |
| Uncommon     | D8  | Expert         |
| Rare         | D10 | Master         |
| Very Rare    | D12 | Grandmaster    |

There are no set values for availability, but as a general rule the
highest die in an item's cost is often equal to its availability rating,
or the level of skill required to create the item, whichever is higher. 

The MJ can change the availability based on the geographic location; for
example, if you are in Lutetia, it's Very Common to find a sword, while
in the Provinces it might be Very Common to buy a draft horse.

The dice pool opposing a Wealth roll is equal to the cost plus the
availability. Buying a sword in Lutetia would be D6 (cost) plus D0
(availability), or 1D6. Buying an Airship in Lutetia is 4D12 (cost) plus
1D12 (availability), or 5D12, since airships are very rarely available
for purchase.

## Making a Wealth Roll

A Wealth roll represents the character's attempt to locate goods or
services, leverage her material assets and personal favors, and purchase
said item. The player makes a roll of her Wealth pool against the cost
and availability, rolled by the MJ.

If the MJ's roll is higher, the character is unable to purchase the item
in question – her personal lines of credit are exhausted, she's low on
cash, there's not one available for the right price, or any other
explanation. This is an opportunity for the MJ and the player to
cooperatively introduce a plot element to describe why the purchase
didn't go through. 

In addition, on a failed Wealth roll, the character drops one die from
her Wealth pool. This is marked on the character sheet by a checkbox.
Dropped dice cannot be used again during the same game session, although
they are restored at the beginning of the next game session.

If the player wins the opposed Wealth roll, she still drops one die from
her Wealth pool to represent the expenditure of resources, and spends
her success points on the following success table:

:::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::
| Wealth Rolls |                       |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Opposition   | Cost and availability |
| \+           | Purchase Item         |
| \++++        | No Drop               |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Purchase Item:** You can purchase the item or service in question. If
the item has a B beside the cost, it can be purchased in bulk, and each
success point you spend gives you one more of the item; otherwise, you
can only purchase the item or service once.

**No Drop:** You don't drop a die from your Wealth pool because of this
roll.

## Dropped Dice

Dropped dice are restored at the start of the next game session. You can
(and probably should) drop a D0 die if it is in your Wealth pool; it's
always best to drop your lowest die rather your highest die.

If you get enough success points on your Wealth roll, you don't have to
drop any dice.

You can't choose to drop Barter or Reward dice when you make a Wealth
roll, as they are not a permanent part of your Wealth pool.

## Buying in Bulk

Certain items in the equipment list can be purchased in bulk; these are
marked by a \[B\] after the cost. For those items, and only those items,
you can buy multiple quantities by expending additional success points.

If you are spending a Reward, you get a quantity of items equal to half
your Reward die size when buying items in bulk. For example, if you
spend a D8 reward on fabric (cost D6), you get 4 pieces of fabric.

## Charmwoven Items

You purchase a Charmwoven item in the same way that you purchase
anything else – but the cost is equal to the base cost of the item plus
the Charm die. This is in addition to the availability, which in most
cases is equal to the Charm die as well.

For example, if you wish to purchase a cavalier hat with a D8 Charm for
Dueling (Riposte), the cost will be D6 for the hat, D8 for the Charm,
and D8 for finding an Expert charmweaver, for a total of 2D8+1D6 as the
opposition to your Wealth roll.

By comparison, an uncharmed cavalier hat would cost D6 plus D0
availability in Lutetia (they're all the rage these days), for a total
of 1D6.

## Cost D0

An item with a cost of D0 is not free; it still requires a successful
Wealth roll to purchase and thus a die dropped (or a D0 or higher Reward
to purchase without rolling).

Likewise, a D0 Reward actually is something, but it doesn't do much
except let you purchase a single D0 item (such as a knife).

A D0 Barter die has no value, however, so you don't need to bother with
those.

## Barter Dice

When you sell items, you gain Barter dice equal to the cost (not the
availability) of the item. Barter dice are recorded on the character
sheet below the Wealth pool, and can be included in a Wealth roll
whenever you wish. However, after being successfully used once, Barter
dice are expended.

You can include as many Barter dice as you have in any given roll, or
you can save them as long as you wish.

On a failed Wealth roll, any Barter dice used are not expended, and can
be used again in the future.

For example, if you want to sell your riding horse (cost D8), you gain a
D8 Barter die. If you then turn around and buy a warhorse, you can
choose to add the D8 to your Wealth roll.

## Rewards

A Reward is a more tangible, less abstract quantity of Wealth, usually
bequeathed by a non-player character. Such Rewards could include a grant
from the Queen, a bounty for capturing a wanted criminal, or a prize for
winning a tournament.

Each Reward has a die value associated with it, from D0 to D12. You can
use a Reward to automatically purchase, without making a Wealth roll,
any item or service which is equal to or less than the Reward's die
value.

New characters begin the game with three Rewards, equal in value to the
dice in their Wealth pool. Additional Rewards should be granted by the
MJ. A typical good deed may net a Reward equal to the player characters'
Competency die, while capturing a fugitive could earn a Reward equaling
the criminal's Competency die.

## Gallinean Currency

The most common coinage used in Gallinea is the Sol, a silver coin
roughly analogous to a modern dollar. A Lune is a copper coin equal to
1/12 of a Sol, while a gold Crown is 12 Sols.

Crowns are stamped with a portrait of the current monarch. Sols have a
sun pattern, and Lunes show a crescent moon.

The approximate values of an item, Barter die, or Reward are shown on
the following table.

Table: Gallinean Currency

| Die | Cost            | Barter Die Value | Reward Value     |
| :-: | :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| D0  | 1-12 Lunes      | 1 Lune           | 12 Lunes (1 Sol) |
| D6  | 1-6 Sols        | 1 Sol            | 6 Sols (½ Crown) |
| D8  | 1-8 Crowns      | 1 Crown          | 8 Crowns         |
| D10 | 10-100 Crowns   | 10 Crowns        | 100 Crowns       |
| D12 | 100-1200 Crowns | 100 Crowns       | 1200 Crowns      |

These numbers are just to facilitate roleplay; you don't use the actual
values except for description. For example, the MJ might say, “She
plunks down a small sack of Crowns on the table” to represent a D8
reward, or state that an airship (cost 4D12) is worth nearly 5,000
Crowns.

Gallinea's neighboring countries have their own currencies but they are
usually interchangeable with Gallinean coins as they're based on the
ancient Qartan money system.
