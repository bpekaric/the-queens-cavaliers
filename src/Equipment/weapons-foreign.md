  - **Brandestoc (Ekalia):** This pole weapon can be mistaken for a
    quarterstaff at first glance, but when the wielder gives a sharp thrust,
    three blades emerge from the end. This is a Drop 2 action, and it gives
    the brandestoc the Reach quality until the end of the current scene.
    
  - **Cinquedea (Ekalia):** Ekalian sailors who may have to fight in close
    quarters favor this dueling dagger, which has a broad blade nearly equal
    to that of a sword.
    
  - **Claymore (Albia):** The Albian greatsword is used primarily by those
    of Mathac heritage and is closely identified with Bear Island.
    
  - **Colichedemarde (Varendia):** *description needed* small sword
    
  - **Dirk (Albia):** *description needed* dagger
    
  - **Espada Ropera (Ondala):** Some might say this is "only" a rapier,
    but it's well-known that the swordcrafters of Ondala produce the finest
    rapiers in the world. Perfectly balanced, the espada ropera is desired
    by fencers across Elara.
    
  - **Hook Prosthesis (Ekalia):** *description needed*
    
  - **Jambiya (Northern Ifran):** This curved knife is a common tool across
    Northern Ifran, and can inflict nasty wounds if it gets past a target's
    defenses.
    
  - **Katzbalger (Varendia):** This heavy Varendish long sword is designed
    for chopping -- arms, shields, legs, armor, whatever. When used with
    both hands, the Weapon Die increases to 1D10.
    
  - **Koncerz (Talania):** *description needed* sabre
    
  - **Montante (Ondala):** *description needed* greatsword
    
  - **Shamshir (Northern Ifran):** *description needed* scimitar
    
  - **Szabla (Talania):** *description needed* sabre
    
  - **Tuck (Albia):** *description neeeded* As with other long swords, using a tuck
    with both hands increases the Weapon Die to 1D10.
    
  - **Zweihander (Varendia):** *description needed* greatsword
