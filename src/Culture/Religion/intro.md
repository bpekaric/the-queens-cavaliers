# Religion in Gallinea

The queendom of Gallinea is explicitly Asrian in nature, although the degree to which
one follows the faith varies from those who only attend services on the first days of
each month to devout zealouts who urge everyone to comply with the Nine Precepts of 
*The Books of the Sun*.

Other religions in Gallinea include the followers of Devra the Desert Mother, Dodekarian
sailors and their pantheon of 12 gods, the relatively new Dualitiarian faith of Albia, 
and those who claim to follow the Five Brothers of the North. 

Although most in Gallinea don't think of it as a separate religion, the Old Faith of the
witches is a set of folk tales, home remedies, domestic ceremonies, superstitions, and other 
beliefs that are followed by members of the lower classes. These practices easily co-exist 
with the Asrian faith, with many who follow the Old Faith considering themselves faithful
Asrians. For them, the Old Faith isn't a competing theological and philosophical system
but "just the way we've always done things."
