# The Gallinean Calendar

Years in Elara are measured from the abandonment of Qarta (Post Qarta), which dates to 1 PQ. Dates before 1 PQ are dated backwards with Before Qarta (BQ). A year without PQ/BQ notation is presumed to be PQ.

Months are named for the common weather in Lutetia during each month.

Each month has 30 days. Each year has 360 days.

## Days of the Week

There are six days of the week in the Gallinean calendar. There are 5 weeks in every month.

Table: Days of the Week

| Number | Day Name   |
| :----: | :--------- |
| 1      | Moon Day   |
| 2      | Second Day |
| 3      | Third Day  |
| 4      | Fourth Day |
| 5      | Stars Day  |
| 6      | Sun Day    |

Asrian worship services are held on Sun Day, which is usually a day off for most. Devrans worship the Desert Goddess on Moon Day, after the sun has gone down.

## Monthly Calendar

Because there are five six-day weeks in every month, each month's calendar is the same. Thus, every full moon is on the 1st of the month and every new moon on the 16th.
