# Diegan Playing Cards

Playing cards have been used in Elara and Ifran for centuries; they are said to 
have been popularized in the Qartan Empire by traders returning from Serica.

These cards are traditionally used for playing games of chance, skill, and 
bluffing, and are popular among people of all social classes in Gallinea.

Some cards are also used for divination purposes, usually adding an additional set of 
"Mysteries" to the normal 52-card deck.

Although most countries have their own variants on deck configuration, the most 
common type of cards are the Diegan standard deck. This deck originated in the city of Diega in 
Ondala, but during the Third Ondalan Tribunals all forms of gambling were outlawed. 
A number of less-than-pious Ondalans left the country to seek their fortune elsewhere, 
many of them joining the Ekalian trading fleets and spreading the Diegan deck around the world.

A Diegan deck consists of 52 cards. Each card has a suit and a rank. 
There are 13 ranks in each suit, and four suits in the deck.

The modern Gallinean names for the Diegan suits are Poignards, Calices, Bâtons, and Sols, as shown on the table below.

Table: Diegan Playing Cards

| Suit Name | Symbol  | Color  |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- |
| Poignard  | Dagger  | Purple |
| Calice    | Chalice | Golden |
| Bâton     | Cudgel  | Blue   |
| Sol       | Coin    | Red    |

The ranks within each suit start at Ace, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 -- the pip cards. 
The remaining three cards per suit are known as the court cards -- the Cavalier, the Prince, and the Monarch. 
The Monarch is the highest ranking card in the deck, although some games favored among the lower classes 
invert the traditional ordering.

It's common within Elara to decorate court cards with the images of the current local rulers, 
and sometimes neighboring rulers as well. If the local equivalent to the Prince is female 
(often the consort of the Monarch), a card painted with her image is known as the Princess and replaces the Prince in the deck.
