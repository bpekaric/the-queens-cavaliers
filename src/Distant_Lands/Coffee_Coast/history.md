# Kheffikan History

Little is known about the history of Kheffika, but linguistic similarities 
catalogued by the lexicographers of Dragosa's Institute of Translation
indicate an ancient connection between the Kheffites and the original
inhabitants of Gallinea, who spoke a language known as *Brigue*.
