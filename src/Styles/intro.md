# Style Maneuvers

This is a summary of all the style maneuvers available to player
characters. Each class and nationality choice gives players access to a
different set of maneuvers; these are the only ones that can be chosen
at character creation. 

## Types of Style Maneuvers

There are three types of Style Maneuvers: reroll maneuvers, maximize
maneuvers, and conditional maneuvers.

### Reroll Maneuvers

A reroll maneuver lets you reroll your entire dice pool. You can
do this immediately after you roll, or you can do it after your opponent
rolls. You ignore your original results and only keep the rerolled
version.

Rerolling costs one Style Point, and you can repeat it if you have
enough Style Points.

### Maximize Maneuvers

A maximize maneuver sets the value of one die in your pool to its
maximum value. You set that die aside and turn it to its maximum
value, before you roll. For example, if you maximize a D10, you set the
value to a 10. Then you roll your dice and calculate your result as if
the maximized value were one that you rolled.

The die you maximize must be one you include in your dice pool from
the associated specialty or item die. If you have a pool that consists
of 1D8 (Verve) + 1D6 (Competency) + 2D8 (Lunge) + 1D10 (Weapon Die) +
1D12 (Advantage Die), you can use a "maximize Lunge die" maneuver only
to maximize one of the D8s from Lunge.

Maximizing a die costs two Style Points, and you can only have one
maximized die in any dice pool. You can't a maximize maneuver after you
roll.

### Conditional Maneuvers

A conditional maneuver has a specific condition that must be met in
order for you to use it. When you do so, you add the dice from one
source to a different dice pool. Adding the dice from a second
specialty doesn't give you the Attribute Die, Competency Die, or Item
Die from the second dice pool, but it does give you a number of dice
equal to your specialty ranks. The size of each such die is determined
by your attribute; if you have +2 Lunge and your Verve is D8, then you
add +2D8 to another pool as directed by the maneuver.

If you don't have any ranks at all in a specialty but you're
Competent with the appropriate Skill, you can instead add your
Competency Die as another Specialty die. If you aren't Competent with
the skill at all, you probably made a poor choice for a style maneuver;
you can add 1D6 to the roll instead as a Specialty Die.

Using a conditional maneuver requires one Style Point. If you meet
the criteria for multiple conditional maneuvers and you want to spend
the Style Points, you use as many such maneuvers as you like on one die
roll. You need to decide before you roll, not after.

When you add dice from one specialty to another roll, that second
roll also becomes a pool of that type in addition to its own. In other
words, if you have a maneuver that lets you "add Husbandry dice to a
Lunge" roll and you spend the Style Point to use it, the roll is both a
Lunge roll and a Husbandry roll. This can allow for adding in additional
style maneuvers as a combo.
