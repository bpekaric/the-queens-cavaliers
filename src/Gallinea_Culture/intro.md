# Gallinean Culture 

Gallinea has a long history as a matriarchy, and in recent centuries has become 
known for its very egalitarian and inclusive views – a philosophy which has been 
tested since the former monarch, Queen Elisse, was assassinated. Her youngest 
daughter, now Queen Mariana, has tried to maintain her mother's policy of 
tolerance in the face of increasing clamor for a less open society.

Gender equality is usually a given in Gallinea, and freedom of religion is enforced 
by law – although only Asrianism is broadly accepted. Heterosexuality is the norm, 
but pansexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality are all embraced and supported by 
society. Gallinean inheritance passes along a matrilineal path, so most heads of 
noble families are female. The symbol of Gallinea is the pegasus.
