### Workrooms

Basic sets of handheld tools are described <a href="#tools-of-the-trade" class="xref-insection"></a>,
and can be used as an Item Die on appropriate crafting rolls.

However, most serious crafting work is done in some kind of dedicated
room or outbuilding. Such workrooms have everything you'd find in a set
of tools, plus additional equipment, furniture, and resources for each
task. These workrooms can provide an Item Die, as shown on the following
table. As you can only have one Item Die per dice pool, you can't
combine the Item Die from a set of tools with the Item Die from a
workroom.

Table: Workrooms

| Room            | Cost | Item Die |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- |
| Artist's Studio | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Kitchen         | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Laboratory      | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Library         | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Medical Theatre | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Observatory     | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Séance Room     | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Smithy          | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Workshop        | 2D10 | \+1D10   |

Most workrooms are only available in cities, although some smaller towns
might be able to provide an artist's studio, a kitchen, a séance room,
or a smithy. Setting up a workroom takes 8 hours of work, although that
can be done by either one person or divided among several.

Superior workrooms can be purchased for twice the listed cost and an
Item Die of one step higher. A superior kitchen costs 4D8 and gives a
+1D10 Item Die on rolls for cooking. Superior workrooms take 20 hours to
set up and can only be acquired in large cities.
