### Arts

The Culture (Arts) specialty allows you to create works of art. The
types of works include drawings, paintings, poetry, sculptures, plays,
songs, opera, novellas, or even cake decorating.

**Base Time:** The base time depends on the type of artistic endeavor.
Most simple works of art will take a minimum of 1 hour, such as Writing
materials a poem, composing a melody, or sketching a drawing.
Sculptures, paintings, novellas, acts of plays, chapters of novels, and
other longer forms have a base time of 1 day.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your artisan tools or artist's studio
to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** art media are usually required, although poetry, plays,
novellas, and songs require Writing materials supplies, and cake
decorating requires foodstuffs.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Culture (Arts).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft Artwork (1 unit of art media):** You create a basic item of art.
Choose a one-word Tag, usually associated with an emotion, place, or
concept. The Tag has a Bonus Die of +1D0, and can be used when
displaying or performing the work of art.

**Add a Tag:** You can add another Tag to your artwork. The new Tag has
a Bonus Die of +1D0.

**Improve Artwork (1 unit of art media):** The Bonus Die of one Tag
improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of specialty
ranks you have in Culture (Arts).

**Reduce Material Cost:** You reduce the overall cost of this Crafting
roll by one unit of art media.

**Create Forgery (1 unit of art media):** You make a copy of someone
else's artwork. It's indistinguishable from the original except on close
examination. The forgery has no Tags attached, but you can use success
points to add a Tag. The Standard Opposition to an Arts or Perception
roll to detect the work as a forgery is Easy (3D6). For every 2
additional success points you spend, the difficulty increases by one
step, limited by your number of ranks in Culture (Arts).

**Pièce de Résistance!:** You create a work of art that will be spoken
of for decades, if not centuries. Any Tag Die on the work of art is
automatically maximized when used as a Bonus Die.
