### Blackpowder

You can craft blackpowder weapons such as grenades and cannons. You can
also work with phlogistone to create phlogistone furnaces or other uses
of phlogistone.

**Base Time:** Working with blackpowder typical requires one hour, while working with phlogistone takes one day.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your metalworking tools, smithy, or workshop to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Blackpowder charges are required for all crafting with
this specialty, and crucible steel for most uses. In addition, many
types of explosives require additional materials as shown on the
following
table.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
