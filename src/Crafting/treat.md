### Treat

You can craft medicine and cures for diseases with the Medicine (Treat) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting medicine takes 1 hour. Crafting a disease cure takes 1 day.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your alchemy tools or laboratory to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** medicine require alchemical ingredients; disease cures require medicine.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Medicine (Treat).

**Extra Supplies:** You can use extra supplies while crafting to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Treat).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft medicine (1 unit of alchemical ingredients):** You create two
units of medicine for every 1 success point and 1 unit of alchemical
ingredients you spend.

**Craft Known Cure (2 units of medicine):** You create one dose of a
cure for a known disease. The cure is effective for 24 hours, although
the potency can be extended by another 24 hours for each success point
you spend. Each extra success point and unit of medicine you spend
creates another dose of the same cure.

**Duplicate Cure (2 units of medicine):** You duplicate the curative
properties of a cure without knowing the exact treatment for it, as long
as you have a sample. You create one dose of the cure, and for every
extra success point and unit of medicine you create another dose. The
cure is effective for only 12 hours and cannot be extended.

**Eureka!  (5 units of medicine):** You've invented a new cure for the
disease you're treating. You craft one dose of the cure, and for every
extra success point and unit of medicine you create another one. The
cure is effective for 24 hours, although you can extend the potency by
another 24 hours for each success point you spend. From now on, you can
create this cure as a "known cure" as can anyone who you instruct.
