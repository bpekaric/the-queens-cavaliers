### Strategy

You can create written materials to be used in military operations with the Military (Strategy) specialty.

**Base Time:** Drafting military materials takes 1 hour.

**Supplies:** Writing materials are required for crafting with Strategy.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on writing to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Military (Strategy).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to write your materials by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the writing.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Draft Battle Plans (1 unit of writing materials):** You create a basic
plan of battle for a specific place and time. The plans give a +1D0
Bonus Die on Military (Strategy) rolls for that location, and are valid
for 1 week (6 days). The time can be extended by 1 week for each
additional success point you spend.

**Improve Battle Plans (1 unit of writing materials):** The Bonus Die of
your battle plans increased by one die size. You are limited by the
number of specialty ranks you have in Military (Strategy).

**Issue Orders (1 unit of writing materials):** You issue orders to one
person under your command based on your battle plans. (Orders given to
officers apply to all troops under that officer's command). If your
orders are followed, your subordinate gains a +1D6 Item Die on Military
(Strategy), Nature (Explore) and Nature (Prowl) rolls related to those
plans. For each additional success point and unit of writing materials,
you can issue orders to another subordinate. For each additional 2
success points you spend, the Item Die of your orders improves by one
die size, limited by your specialty ranks in Military (Strategy).

**Forge Orders (1 unit of writing materials):** You create a forgery of
military orders that appear to come from a specific commander. This can
include fake letters of promotion, forged military identification
papers, and legitimate-looking orders that will actually end in
disaster. When someone attempts to analyze these orders, the standard
opposition is Easy (3D6). The difficulty increases by one step for every
2 success points and 1 unit of writing materials you spend.
