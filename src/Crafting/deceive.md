### Deceive

You can create an alternate identity for yourself, including creating a disguise, by using the Interaction (Deceive) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting an identity takes 1 day.

**Supplies:** Fabric or alchemical components may be required for certain aspects of your new identity

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in the Specialty.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your identity by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

**Craft Identity (1 unit of fabric):** You create an alternate identity.
That identity has a different name from you, although it otherwise has
all the same qualities as you (general appearance, gender, etc). To
casual observers, though, you're different people -- perhaps you put on
a pair of spectacles in your new identity? You have a +1D0 Bonus Die
when trying to pass yourself off as your new identity. Your identity
lasts for up to 24 hours.

You can spend additional success points to alter your appearance. Each
alteration you make to your appearance costs 1 success point and one
additional unit of supplies, as shown on the following table.

Table: Identity Changes

| Alteration           | Supplies Cost                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Apparent age         | 1 unit of alchemical ingredients |
| Apparent gender      | 1 unit of fabric                 |
| Apparent height      | 1 unit of fabric                 |
| Apparent nationality | 1 unit of alchemical ingredients |
| Apparent weight      | 1 unit of fabric                 |
| Hair color           | 1 unit of alchemical ingredients |
| Hair style           | 1 unit of alchemical ingredients |

**Improve Identity:** The Bonus Die afforded by your false identity
improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of specialty
ranks you have in Interaction (Deceive).

**Make a Connection:** You go out in public and are seen are by one
reputable person who will unwittingly vouch for your identity. Each
additional success point gives you another person who thinks you're who
you're pretending to be.

**Maintain Identity:** Your identity lasts an additional 24 hours for
every extra success point you spend. While your identity is active, you
can make another Deceive roll to extend the duration; the cost to make
this roll is equal to your original supplies cost for Craft Identity.
You can only spend your success points on Make Connection, Maintain
Identity, Improve Identity, or Persistent Identity if you make such a
roll.

**Assume Someone's Identity (3 units of fabric, 3 units of alchemical
ingredients):** You disguise yourself as a specific person, adopting
their appearance and identity.

**Persistent Identity:** The identity you've crafted is so airtight that
you can maintain it indefinitely without being discovered.
