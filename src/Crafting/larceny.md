### Larceny

You can create forged documents, imitation jewelry, locks, traps, and
alarms with the Streetwise (Larceny) specialty.

**Base Time:** Creating a forgery or an obstacle takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your repair tools or workshop to your dice pool when working with locks or traps.

**Supplies:** Clockwork gears are required for creating locks or traps,
Writing materials materials are required for forging documents, and art
media for duplicating jewelry.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Streetwise (Larceny).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
