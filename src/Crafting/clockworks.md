### Clockworks

You can clockwork devices, casings, and components with the Science (Clockworks) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting clockwork items requires 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your repair tools or workshop to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Clockwork gears are required for creating anything with Clockworks, except for clockwork gears -- which require crucible steel.

**Plans:** If you have plans for the type of device or component you're
trying to create, add the Bonus Die of the plans to your dice pool.
Plans are created with the Science (Calculus) specialty.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting a clockwork item to
add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by
your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your clockwork item by
taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're
taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much
you rush the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft Component (1 or more units of clockwork gears):** You create a
clockwork component. If it has an Item Die, it starts at +1D6. For each
additional success point you spend, the Item Die increases one step,
limited by your ranks in Science (Clockworks).

**Craft Clockwork Gears (1 unit of crucible steel):** You create two
units of clockwork gears. For each additional unit of crucible steel you
spend, you create another two units of clockwork gears.

**Craft Casing (1 or more units of crucible steel):** You create a
casing for a clockwork device. The amount of steel you must spend
depends on the size of the casing.

**Assemble Device:** You complete a clockwork device. You must have all
of the device's components in order to assemble it.

**Craft Power Source (special):** You create a power source that can be
installed in a device. The supplies cost varies depending on the type of
power source you're using.

**Duplicate A Device (special):** You create a duplicate of an existing
clockwork device. You must spend the same amount and type of supplies to
create the duplicate as was spent to create the original.
