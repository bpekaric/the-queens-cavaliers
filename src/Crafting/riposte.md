### Riposte

You can craft knives with the Riposte specialty.

**Prowess Required:** You can only create knives if you have Knife Prowess.

**Base Time:** Crafting a weapon takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your metalworking tools or smithy to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Supplies of crucible steel are required for creating weapons.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Defense (Riposte).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
