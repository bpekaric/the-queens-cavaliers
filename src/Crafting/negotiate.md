### Negotiate

You can craft legal documents, including business contracts, treaties,
bills of sale, identity papers, and more, by using the Interaction
(Negotiate) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting a contract, treaty, or identity papers takes one hour, and crafting a bill of sale takes one minute.

**Supplies:** Crafting any sort of document requires writing materials.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Interaction (Negotiate).

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft Basic Document (1 unit of writing materials):** You create a
basic legal document, such as a bill of sale. If signed by at least one
party and used in later negotiations, it provides you with a +1D0 Bonus
Die.

**Improve Document (1 unit of writing materials):** The document's Bonus
Die improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of specialty
ranks you have in Interaction (Negotiate).

**Craft Complex Document (5 units of writing materials):** You create a
complex legal document, such as a treaty, a business contract, or
identity papers. If signed by all parties involved and used in later
negotiations, it provides you with a +1D0 Bonus Die.

**Forge Document:** The document you create isn't actually legally
binding, but it looks authentic to casual inspection -- including any
signatures you have access to. You can only do this with a basic
document, or with the signatures on a complex document. The standard
opposition for attempts to detect the forgery starts at Easy (3D6) and
increases by one die size for every 2 success points you spend.

**Include Loophole (1 unit of writing materials):** You add a loophole
into the document that renders the document null and void under a
specific circumstance. You decide that circumstance when you create the
document, but it's not obvious to any other parties to the agreement.
You can choose to reveal the loophole whenever the circumstances are
right. You can only do this with a complex document.
