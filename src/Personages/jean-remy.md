# Prince Jean-Remy

Prince Jean-Remy of Gallinea was born Princess Renee, younger sibling 
of Queen Elisse, but from an early age was ill-suited for the princess role. 
Instead, he took the name of his paternal grandfather and eschewed the 
pageantry of the royal court for the study of military history. 
An accomplished fencer and shrewd negotiator, he was appointed as the 
Gallinean ambassador to Ondala where he built a sizable espionage operation. 
Upon the unexpected death of his sister Elisse and his beloved niece Jehanne 
six years ago, Jean-Remy returned to Lutetia and is the head of Gallinea’s 
spy network as well as one of Queen Mariana’s trusted advisors.

Jean-Remy is a handsome man in his late 40s with a neatly trimmed mustache 
and a slight build, although he is rarely seen out and about around the palace 
or capital. Some say he’s simply very good at hiding, while others claim 
the spymaster is also an expert disguise artist. Jean-Remy speaks calmly and quietly, 
rarely if ever raising his voice, but he is far from passive when it comes to 
defending his country and family. Those who have underestimated the Prince often 
pay for that mistake with their lives, as he is more than willing to kill for Mariana.

The relationship between Prince Jean-Remy and his brother-in-law Prince-Father 
Michel is one of mutual respect, as both know the other has the Queen’s interests at heart. 
Jean-Remy does not care for Prince-Consort Carolus, although he is not above subtly 
manipulating him to hear the latest secrets of Albia’s ambassador, the Duke of Bedyngford. 
Guardian Farrazin and Prince Jean-Remy despise each other, as they have competing 
intelligence-gathering operations within the same nation.
