# Religion in Gallinea {.breakbefore}

The queendom of Gallinea is explicitly Asrian in nature, although the degree to which
one follows the faith varies from those who only attend services on the first days of
each month to devout zealouts who urge everyone to comply with the Nine Precepts of 
*The Books of the Sun*.

Other religions in Gallinea include the followers of Devra the Desert Mother, Dodekarian
sailors and their pantheon of 12 gods, the relatively new Dualitiarian faith of Albia, 
the Old Faith of the witches, and those who claim to follow the Five Brothers of the North.
