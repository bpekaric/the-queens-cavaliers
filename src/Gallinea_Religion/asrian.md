Originally worshiped as a sun deity by the Qartans, belief in the Goddess-Empress Ashra 
(known as *Eserre* in Gallinea) has spread throughout Elara. Asrianism is the state religion 
of Ondala, Gallinea, and Varendia, and the complex hierarchy of the faith is centered in  
the Ondalan city of Cordera. Asrian clergy are known as Chaplains, and are led by senior
chaplains known as Guardians of the Faith.

## Symbolism

The *soleil-de-eserre* is the symbol of the Asrian church, representing the sun of Ashra.

Four *soleils-de-eserre* appear on the Gallinean flag, and one on the Ondalan flag. 
A *soleil-de-eserre* is also found on one side of the sol, the Gallinean unit of currency.

## The Books of the Sun

*The Books of the Sun* are a collection of Asrian holy writings penned between 1400 BQ and 300 BQ, 
centered on the teachings of the goddess Eserre. *The Books* are written in Old Qartan, although a
few unofficial translations into Gallinean exist.. The Nine Precepts are central passages in the Books.

## The Nine Precepts

Asrianism is centered around nine principles, purportedly laid down by the goddess Essere, known as the Nine Precepts.
These principles guide devout Asrian believers, although the way that each is interpreted is up to 
that individual.

The Precepts are traditionally divided into three groups: The Three Professions, The Three Directives, and The Three Prohibitions.

### The Three Professions

1. There is one Sun in the sky, source of light and life.
2. Light, life, and love are the Sun's gifts to us.
3. We are all of us children of the Sun.

The First Precept is seen as a basic confession of faith and dedication to Essere. 
The Second Precept lays down what Asrians believe are the basic rights of humanity:
to have light and warmth, to live, and to have loving relationships of any kind.
The Second is also the foundation for a philosophy of charity, making sure that
everyone has what they need for life. The Third Precept is a statement of universal
siblinghood and thus unity. Note that the Sun cares not on whom She shines, for
She shines on both believers and non-believers alike.

### The Three Directives

4. Freely partake of only that which has been given to you.
5. Repay kindness three times, and harm but once.
6. Truth endures forever while falsehoods wither in the light.

The Fourth Precept has been broadly interpreted not only as a prohibition against
theft, but also other crimes against a person such as sexual assault. The Fifth
Precept calls on faithful Asrians to practice kindness in their daily lives, and
is also seen as a directive that any punishments must not be excessive. The
Sixth Precept teaches Asrians that honesty, both to others and to yourself, is
vitally necessary.

### The Three Prohibitions

7. Let no man be superior to a woman.
8. Let no one own another person.
9. Let no one kill except to sustain life.

The Seventh Precept is perhaps the most controversial of the Nine. It has been interpreted as
everything from a demand female supremacy in all areas of society, to a rule on seating
etiquette. Most scholars of *The Books* believe the Seventh was written in reaction
to a male-dominated society of centuries past, and was not meant to imply the opposite, to declare
that women should be superior to men. The theological history behind the Seventh has had
little impact on the lay interpretations of the Precept.

The Eighth Precept is anti-slavery, and is responsible for the lack of an organized slave
trade of any kind in Elara. Most Asrians consider the Eighth to be the most unnecessary and
old-fashioned of the Precepts, since slavery has not existed for millennia. The Ninth Precept
is, like the Seventh, interpreted in a number of different ways, but all theologians agree
that Eserre is against murder. Whether the prohibition extends to situations of self-defense, 
to animals, to a state of war, to unborn fetuses ... is all up to interpretation.

## The Matriarch

At the top of the Asrian church's hierarchy sits the Matriarch. The Matriarch is formally
known as the Bride of the Sun, regardless of whether the Matriarch is a woman or a man.
Legend says that the first Matriarch was a young woman who was literally married to Eserre in
ancient Qarta, and thus when a new Matriarch is elevated from the ranks of the Chaplains,
a ceremonial wedding is performed before the masses.

The current Matriarch is Isabene de la Justicia, the former Guardian of the Faith of
the Fuenta province in Cordera. She rose to the position from humble beginnings and 
accordingly urges those who follow the Asrian faith to eschew rampant materialism and 
instead offer communal assistance to those who need it. De la Justicia is not very popular
among the nobility.
