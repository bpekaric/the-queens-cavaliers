### Heroes of Talania

\#\# blurb

### The Skomorokh

Talania, before the Shattering Frost, had a long tradition of folk dance
in elaborate, colorful costumes. These "skomorokh" were more than just
harlequins, more than mere performers; their parodies and satires served
to represent the common people in the face of oppression by the
bojarynias and tsarinas of the court. By passing themselves off as
simple "clowns" or "jesters," the skomorokhs were able to tell truths
that the ruling families would not want to be spoken openly.

With the fall of Zamorov, the skomorokhs migrated with the rest of the
Talanian populace to warmer climes, settling in Dragosa, Gallinea, and
other lands of the Middle Sea. Unfortunately, the nobility outside of
Talania lack a cultural tradition of tolerating the dancers' antics,
leading to many troubles for skomorokhs outside of their homeland.

### The Toymaker

The craftsmen of Talania were renowned for their skill at creating
lifelike dolls and other toys for children; eventually they began to
incorporate both charmweaving and clockworks into their most advanced
toys. Mostly unknown outside of Talania, they were curiosities only for
the richest of foreigners until the Shattering Frost. Now, as the
Talanian diaspora spreads throughout the Middle Sea, children of all
social ranks have greater access to these entertainments.

Toymakers are some of the few Talanian refugees allowed to ply their own
trade in Dragosa and in Valerienne without fear of reprisal from their
neighbors, as they rarely compete with any local industries. Toymakers
are usually among the richest within a given Talanian enclave, and often
become leaders within their communities.

### Talanian Clockworks

The toysmiths of Talania have perfected the ability to work at minuscule
size, producing tiny clockwork devices and components. These are highly
valued by collectors in Gallinea and elsewhere -- at least, if they date
before the Shattering Frost. Newer devices are made with just as much
skill, but the talents of contemporary refugee clockworkers are not
valued in most of Elara.

#### Arcanimation Engine (power source)

Comprised of charms and clockworks woven together in a cloth-driven
miniature turbine, arcanimation engines are the preferred power source
for most Talanian micro-devices. (Mainsprings are a far second.)

An arcanimation engine provides just a tiny amount of power, but it's
enough to run the types of lower-power clockworks found in toys and
dolls. An arcanimation engine supplies power for one hour, then the
charms shut down to recover that power back over the next six hours.
After six hours, the arcanimation engine can provide power again.

The power supplied by an arcanimation engine can be only be used to run
Articulation, Calculation, Carry, Efficiency, Harmonicon, Measurement,
Miniaturization, or Movement components. In addition, the specific
components powered can be no larger than 1 gear space each.

Creating an Arcanimation Engine: The Magicks (Weave) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create an arcanimation
engine. You are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as
shown on the table
below.

###### Arcanimation Engines

| 1     | D12 (1, 1)           | Clockworks +5, Weave +5 | 5              |

#### Harmonicon (component)

A harmonicon component plays predefined music when activated. A more
complex harmonicon can play more than one composition, and a Computation
component can be added for even more advanced music generation.

**Instrument Types:** A harmonicon can include the following types of
instruments: idiophones (percussion instruments), lamellophones (jaw
harps and music boxes), membranophones (drums), chordophones (string
instruments and harpsichords), and aerophones (wind instruments).
Harmonicons can't reproduce human voices or any kind of speech.

**Creating a Harmonicon Component:** The Culture (Arts) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create a harmonicon. You
are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as shown on
the table below.
