### Dragosan History

*introdcution needed*

### Volstok, Capital of Dragosa

*description needed*

### Tri-Lingual

Dragosa has three official languages -- Ekalian, Talanian, Varendish. Dragosans generally speak at least two of these languages and usually all three; there is no particular ethnic or ancestral attachment to anyone particular language; it's common to find Dragosans of Ekalian descent perfectly fluent in Varendish and Talanian, for example. Many conversations are held in a mix of all three languages, blending together terminology from different sources into a uniquely Dragosan argot.

##### Talanian Refugees

Former inhabitants of Talania, fleeing from the encroachment of the
Shattering Frost, have flooded the northern and central parts of
Dragosa. These immigrants are seen to threaten the multicultural nature
of Dragosa by lack of fluency in Ekalian and Varendish, and as such are
limited in what roles they can play in Dragosan society. With the
inability to return to their ancestral homelands, the Talanian refugees
are at risk of becoming a permanent lower class within Dragosa.

### Dragosan Names

Dragosan names are drawn from the names of the countries surrounding Dragosa,
mixing a variety of Ekalian, Talanian, and Varendish names. Each Dragosan
has four names that comprise their formal name:

- a personal name, used in day to day communication
- first parental name, either parent (order doesn't matter)
- second parental name, either parent
- a location name, denoting where the Dragosan either was born, proceeded by *tol-*, or permanently resides, proceeded by *zol-*

*Example:* Two Dragosans are named *Hille Senna Zanobia tol-Faldra*
and *Flordiana Piero Stemid zol-Volstok*. They have a child born in Volstok 
named *Baldanca Hille Flordiana tol-Volstok*.

If the identity of either parent is unknown or hidden, then the prefix of the place-name
changes to *tal-* or *zal-* to indicate that one or both parent's name was omitted.

If the location of birth is unknown and the person is Dragosan, then *zol-Dragosa*,
*zal-Dragosa*, *tol-Dragosa*, or *tal-Dragosa* is used. 
For foreigners, *tur-* is prefixed to the country name.

*Example:* Hille's parents are *Senne Kels Caltuna tol-Dragosa* and *Zanobia Aladina tal-Faldra*.
This indicates that one parent, Senne, is from an unknown location -- *tol-Dragosa* -- and the
other parent, Zanobia, is from Faldra. The identity of one grandparent is unknown, as indicated by
the *tal-* prefix.

An even more formal pattern of naming involves expanding the parents' formal names, used
only in the most important ceremonies and in legal documentation. 

*Example*: Baldanca's legal name, going one generation back, would be 
*Baldanca Hille Senne Zanobia tol-Faldra Flordiana Piero Stemid zol-Volstok tol-Volstok*.

More than two generations back is considered unwieldy as it soons becomes an entire
genealogy. However, this is exactly what the Institute of Ancestry, based in Faldra, uses
as an official identifier, known as one's institute name.

*Example:* Baldanca's institute name is 
*Baldanca Hille Senne Kels Caltuna tol-Dragosa Zanobia Aladina tal-Faldra tol-Faldra Flordiana Piero Warb Anzola zol-Tanna Stemid tur-Talania zol-Volstok tol-Volstok*.
While she can probably breathlessly recite this from memory, she would rarely, if ever, need to share this with anyone.

Needless to say, Dragosan names can be quite confusing to people from other countries.

#### Common Dragosan Namesa

When borrowed from neighboring countries, Dragosan names that were traditionally tied to a
certain gender become non-gendered. All names in Dragosa are considered appropriate for
any person, regardless of gender or the country of origin.

#### The Lexicographer

With a diverse, multilingual nation, the people of Dragosa are often
themselves amateur linguists. Some of the most respected scholars in
Volstok are found in the Institute of Translation, where they catalogue
words, rephrase idioms, transliterate classic works in other tongues,
and decipher fragmentary texts.

Field researchers from the Institute range far and wide throughout
Elara, Ifran, and beyond -- seeking to capture jkkke in the wild and
bind it into book form, for storage in their guild's libraries.

#### The Hanaster

Dragosan merchants do a lot of trade both within and outside of Dragosa,
with many willing to travel quite far in order to earn gold dragas.
Serica, the Coffee Coast, Mwene Karanga, the Storm Islands -- nowhere is
too far to go if a profit can still be turned by the journey. The
highest ranking merchants are part of the Hanaster guilds, and are
effectively nobility within Dragosan cities.

Hanasters are skilled at turning a profit, knowing what is most valuable
at any given location and where it can be acquired for the cheapest.
Most train in the basics of self defense, if just to protect themselves
from thievery.
