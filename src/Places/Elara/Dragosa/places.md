### Volstok, Capital of Dragosa

*description needed*

##### Talanian Refugees

Former inhabitants of Talania, fleeing from the encroachment of the
Shattering Frost, have flooded the northern and central parts of
Dragosa. These immigrants are seen to threaten the multicultural nature
of Dragosa by lack of fluency in Ekalian and Varendish, and as such are
limited in what roles they can play in Dragosan society. With the
inability to return to their ancestral homelands, the Talanian refugees
are at risk of becoming a permanent lower class within Dragosa.
