### Ekalian History
Ekalia is a group of islands to the southeast of Gallinea; Thedis is the largest city-state and center of trade for the region.

The civilizations of the Ekalian isles were old when the Qartan Empire conquered them, with a history dating back millennia. Ekalians have no queen or king, but instead choose Electors from among their citizens to form a ruling council, called the Plenum. From these, the High Elector is chosen to rule over the island country.

Each island of Ekalia is its own city-state, with economics and politics within each controlled by one or more powerful merchant families. Ekalia is renowned for its shipbuilding and trading prowess; Ekalia controls the Inner Sea like no other navy has since the Qartan Empire.

### Ekalian Names

Most Ekalians have both a first name and surname. Originally, Ekalian
surnames were based on city-state, island, or village of origin.
Surnames are inherited along family lines. When a child reaches
the age of 16 and is considered a voting member of Ekalian society,
they can choose to take the surname of their mother, their father, 
or neither.

#### The Sibyl

The High Twelve of the Dodekarian faith speak to their mortal worshipers
through signs and dreams, as they have for centuries. The priestesses
(and sometimes priests) of these very human-like deities are known as
Sibyls -- oracles who speak the words of the gods while in the grip of
the powerful Kykeon brew. While highly respected by all within Ekalian
society, Sibyls are prevented from participating in the Ekalian
representational government structure -- a Sibyl is expected to remain
apart from the secular politics of the land, although they may advise on
matters of faith.
