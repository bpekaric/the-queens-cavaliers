#### The Sibyl

The High Twelve of the Dodekarian faith speak to their mortal worshipers
through signs and dreams, as they have for centuries. The priestesses
(and sometimes priests) of these very human-like deities are known as
Sibyls -- oracles who speak the words of the gods while in the grip of
the powerful Kykeon brew. While highly respected by all within Ekalian
society, Sibyls are prevented from participating in the Ekalian
representational government structure -- a Sibyl is expected to remain
apart from the secular politics of the land, although they may advise on
matters of faith.
