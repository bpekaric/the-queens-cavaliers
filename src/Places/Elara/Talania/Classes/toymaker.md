### The Toymaker

The craftsmen of Talania were renowned for their skill at creating
lifelike dolls and other toys for children; eventually they began to
incorporate both charmweaving and clockworks into their most advanced
toys. Mostly unknown outside of Talania, they were curiosities only for
the richest of foreigners until the Shattering Frost. Now, as the
Talanian diaspora spreads throughout the Middle Sea, children of all
social ranks have greater access to these entertainments.

Toymakers are some of the few Talanian refugees allowed to ply their own
trade in Dragosa and in Valerienne without fear of reprisal from their
neighbors, as they rarely compete with any local industries. Toymakers
are usually among the richest within a given Talanian enclave, and often
become leaders within their communities.
