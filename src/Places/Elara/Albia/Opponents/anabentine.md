### The Royal Family

Prince-consort Carolus, Mariana's husband, is the youngest son of King
Edgar II and Queen Fionna. Their eldest son Crown Prince Edmund (36
years old) is next in line for the throne. In between the two is
Princess Anabentine (33) and Prince Rupert (32). Carolus also has 3
younger sisters, twin Princessess Mariah and Esther (25) and Princess
Aurelia (21). 

King Edgar has two surviving younger sisters, Princesses Elizabeth and
Victoria. Princess Elizabeth has chosen to devote her life to the
Dualitarian faith as has her niece Anabentine. Victoria and her wife
have five children total.

Queen Fionna and her sister Lillian were the last surviving members of
House Warrington, a great noble family that was plagued by daughters in
the last two generations. After Fionna wed then-Prince Edgar she
arranged for her sister to marry a royal-adjacent cousin, Fitzwilliam
Bosevell. As Fitzwilliam and Edgar were particularly close, the formerly
Warrington sisters remained close as well. Lillian had six children
herself -- Fitzwilliam, John, Morgan, Matthew, Margaret, and Walter.
