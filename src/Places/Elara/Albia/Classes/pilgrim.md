#### The Pilgrim

Dualitarianist clergy combine beliefs from both the Asrian and Devran
faith traditions, and are known as "Pilgrims" to honor Dackin Orwand's
pilgrimage to the Lost City of Aad -- although none are presumed to
actually want to repeat that long journey. "Orwand has already made the
pilgrimage, and that is sufficient for all" is a common refrain.

Pilgrims are expected to give succor to the sick and dying, and are
found in Dualitarian hospitals as well as churches.
