Unlike Gallinea, its neighbor Albia is a patriarchal society and has
been for centuries. Only a few queens have ruled Albia, fewer than the
number of Kings Regnant in Gallinea.

Located on the Albian peninsula, Albia has had periodic times of
isolationism and expansionism. In past centuries, Albia has controlled
land in both Scanbreille and Albingia in Varendia. The latter has always
been a sticking point, with both nations claiming sovereignty over the
north-facing coast.

### History of Albia

The earliest known kingdom in Albia was the Mathac civilization,
centered around what is now known as Bear Island. The Mathains rose to
rule over a peninsula that was united for the first time, although it
lasted less than two centuries before falling to the Qartan Empire. Only
Bear Island itself escaped being conquered by the Empire of the Sun,
while the rest of Albia had its first female ruler -- a regent appointed
by far-off Qarta.

Despite constant, low-level guerrilla insurgency, Qarta's regents
managed to keep a hold on Albia until the Empire itself fell. As the
Qartan legions crumbled, the Mathains returned from their island exile,
only to find an Albia they scarcely recognized. Widespread Asrian
beliefs and Qartan social mores meant that the populace could never
truly be Mathac again.

The Reconquest of Albia, then, was more of a prolonged period of
cultural blending than an actual military campaign, eventually resulting
in a society that was not fully Mathac, not fully Qartan.

With the Reconquest occupying the attention of Albians for generations,
the world went on as if the peninsula didn't exist. During this time of
isolationism, intermarriage between the Mathains and the Qartans worked
to unite the country. Older Mathac customs, such as rule by a king
regnant, fit together with worship of Ashra, the Qartan sun goddess.

Established as a single nation, the Albians emerged from their isolation
to begin pushing into the rest of Elara. With Varendia in one of its own
cycles of disunity, the Albians were able to claim Albingia with minimal
military force, holding it against the scheming Varendish nobles for
over a century.

Albia faced more resistance when expanding into Gallinea; the first
Albian War led to a complete rout of the Albian armies, driven back deep
into their home peninsula. This would be the first of many wars between
the two nations, with the most recent ending a mere eight years ago in
1241.

Blocked from claiming more territory in Elara, the Albians began to
settle the lands of western Ifran, finding mostly cold and dismal
swampland huddling in the mountains of Ifran's Spine. The discovery of
phlogistone on land claimed by both Gallinean and Albian colonists
precipitated the start of the 20 Year's War in 1221. 

With both nations feeling the weight of two decades of war and Albia
suffering under the Elaran Plague, secret negotiations spearheaded by
the Duke of Bedyngford on the Albian side and Chaplain Farrazin, then
Gallinea's Minister of Peace, led to the Treaty of Scanbreille. The
Treaty arranged a political marriage between Princess Mariana of
Gallinea and Prince Carolus of Albia, the younger siblings to the heirs
apparent of each country.

Diplomatic ties between Albia and Gallinea are stronger than they've
ever been, as Carolus is now Prince-Consort to Queen Mariana, due to the
assassinations of Mariana's mother and older sister. However, old
rivalries die hard, and old war injuries even harder.

King Edgar and Queen-Consort Fionna still regret that they did not marry
Prince Edmund, their eldest son and heir apparent, to Princess Mariana,
as they envision a Greater Albia that stretches from the tip of the
Storm Islands to the Jeweled Coast. Under Albian rule, of course.

### A Uniquely Albian Heresy

Dualiatarian is a religious philosophy developed in the last two
centuries, holding that the Goddess-Empress and the Desert Mother are
the same being. Dualitarians keep the hierarchical structure of the
Asrian church while adopting the stern moralism of the Devrans.
Dualitarian clergy are known as Pilgrims.

The Asrian scriptures, the *Books of the Sun*, and the Devran
scriptures, *Songs of the Desert Mother*, are supplemented by a book
written by Dackin Orwand -- the founder of Dualitarianism -- called
*Orwand's Revelation*. *Revelation* purports to describe the direct
equivalence between Devran and Asrian beliefs while reinterpreting both
to fit the theology of the Dualitarians. Dualitarians are sometimes
scornfully called Orwandans by members of the Asrian faith, but no
Dualitarian would ever apply that term to herself.

Dualitarians eschew symbology save for a simple horizontal
*cross-ordinary*, symbolizing the convergence of the Asrian and Devran
religions in a single faith; such a cross can be seen in the Albian
national flag.

### Dunon, Capital of Albia

The Albian royal family resides in Cadbury Castle in Dunon. Dunon is the
capital of Albia and its main entry from both Gallinea and Varendia. The
surrounding villages extend to the coast of Oceanus. The city is
situated on the bank of the Carlisle River, where it branches into the
Sterling River on one side and continues to the Great Sea on the other.
The Carlisle River makes the trade with Bear Island much more
convenient. Traders often make a dayâ€™s trip from the Island to the
landing at Gawain in Northern Albia. This happens so frequently that
captains often hire a crew for the crossing in one direction and a new
crew for the opposite direction. 

### Bear Island

Bear Island boasts some of the best fishers in Albia -- excluding
perhaps the Storm Islands, which aren't considered part of Albia proper.
Bear Islanders also knit a brightly colored and tightly woven fabric
that is treated with sea lion fat to keep out the cold. This fabric is
in much demand in Talania and formerly in Varendia. 

### Storm Islands

The Storm Islands are largely self sufficient and known for their
fishing prowess and use of sea mammal skins for clothing. While the
group of Islands trades among themselves and speak the same language,
each island tends to speak a slightly different dialect and have their
own traditions. One common tradition is *eilean bocadaich*, or island
hopping. Young people, men in particular, often take small craft from
one island to another looking for a marriage partner.

### Heroes of Albia

#### The Huntsman

The hunters of Albia are known for their mounted hunting parties,
usually with the aid of hunting dogs such as the Albian spaniel. Bows
are the traditional weapons of choice for the hunt, but many in recent
centuries have shifted over to using firearms.

Many huntsmen of the lower social ranks hunt for food or for a
profession, while those from the nobility hunt for sport and for
bragging ranks.

Dualitarianist clergy combine beliefs from both the Asrian and Devran

- **Albian Bulldog:** A breed of dog originally developed for the brutal sport of bull-baiting,
  most Albian bulldogs these days are rather mild in temperament except in defense of their
  owners. An owner can use the bulldog for a Brawl +1D6 Item Die in a fight.
  A purebred bulldog gives a +1D8 Item die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian Hunting Outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The traditional hunting outfit of Albia is
  designed along military lines coupled with practical gloves and boots for handling 
  dogs and riding horses. 

- **Albian Spaniel:** This hunting dog provides an Explore +1D6 Item Die 
  when tracking, moving, or foraging on the ground. When
  tracking an animal on the ground, this Item Die is maximized. A purebred
  Albian spaniel gives a +1D8 Item Die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian War Mastiff:** Albian war mastiffs are a large breed of dog that were extensively used during the 
  Twenty Years' War between Albia and Gallinea. They are strong dogs with powerful jaws that were used as guards 
  and trackers.

- **Frostwoven Apparel:** A frostwoven item requires one bolt of
  frostwoven fabric in addition to the normal cost of the clothing.
  Frostweaving is a Charm, and thus a frostwoven item cannot have an
  additional Charm added; however, a frostwoven item has no Item Die. For
  each frostwoven item worn, the wearer can withstand sub-freezing
  temperatures for 1 hour before feeling the ill effects of such. In
  addition, each item reduces the Drop penalty for cold weather by 1.

- **Greatbow:** Even larger than a standard longbow, an Albian greatbow
  requires more physical strength to use, but also provides a much longer
  effective range. It's less effective at close range, however.

| Weapon   | Hands Required | Prowess | Specialties | Ranges                                                         |
| :------- | :------------- | :------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Greatbow | Two            | Bow     | Aim         | Close (Drop 2), Short (Drop 0), Medium (Drop 0), Long (Drop 1) |

- **Hunting horn:** This horn is rarely used to play actual music, but instead is
  used for sending signals between hunters and their hunting hounds, usually in 
  fox hunting. A skilled huntsman can communicate over a range of up to one league.

- ***Orwand's Revelation:*** A book written by Dackin Orwand of Albia that claims Devra the Desert Mother and Ashra the Goddess-Empress are two 
  aspects of the same deity. Along with *The Books of the Sun* and *The Songs of the Desert Mother*, it is one of the holy books of Dualitarianism,
  and is specifically used to interpret those two books in accordance with Dualitarian theology. It provides a Scholarship +1D8 Item Die
  for topics related to Dualitarianism, and gives a Drop One penalty on rolls related to Asrianism or Devranism.

**Pilgrim's Outfit:** The plain, ordinary clothes of the pilgrim are meant to
  convey a somber seriousness as well as humility. As such, it's almost unheard of
  for a pilgrim's outfit to be charmwoven, and nearly all are of neutral colors
  (white, brown, black, or grey).

### The Royal Family

Prince-consort Carolus, Mariana's husband, is the youngest son of King
Edgar II and Queen Fionna. Their eldest son Crown Prince Edmund (36
years old) is next in line for the throne. In between the two is
Princess Anabentine (33) and Prince Rupert (32). Carolus also has 3
younger sisters, twin Princessess Mariah and Esther (25) and Princess
Aurelia (21). 

King Edgar has two surviving younger sisters, Princesses Elizabeth and
Victoria. Princess Elizabeth has chosen to devote her life to the
Dualitarian faith as has her niece Anabentine. Victoria and her wife
have five children total.

Queen Fionna and her sister Lillian were the last surviving members of
House Warrington, a great noble family that was plagued by daughters in
the last two generations. After Fionna wed then-Prince Edgar she
arranged for her sister to marry a royal-adjacent cousin, Fitzwilliam
Bosevell. As Fitzwilliam and Edgar were particularly close, the formerly
Warrington sisters remained close as well. Lillian had six children
herself -- Fitzwilliam, John, Morgan, Matthew, Margaret, and Walter.
