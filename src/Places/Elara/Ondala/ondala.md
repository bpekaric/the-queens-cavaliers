The island nation of Ondala lies off the southwest coast of Gallinea,
across the Ondalan Channel. Ondala was originally settled by the old
Qartan Empire, and the Ondalans view themselves as the true inheritors
of the Qartan golden age.

The city of Cordera is the head of worship of the Goddess-Empress Asria
(also known as Ashra and Eserre), and home to the Matriarch, the leader
of the church hierarchy. Faithful Chaplains from all of Elara come to
Cordera to train in the Holy College before returning to their home
countries for ministry. Other religions are officially banned within
Ondala.

Over the years, Ondala has been at war with Gallinea, Ekalia, and Albia,
but is currently in a time of relative peace with its neighbors. Most
conflicts arise over their aggressive colony, New Cordera, in West Ifran
and its conflicts with its neighbors.

Like Gallinea, Ondala is a matriarchy; Queen Ximena IV has held the
throne for nearly 40 years, and has been known for her many liaisons
with young women and men of the court. Her power is limited by the
edicts of the Church under the direction of the current Matriarch,
Isabine de la Justicia.

### Heroes of Ondala

#### The Cocinera

Intrigue and betrayal are a national pastime in Ondala, particularly in
the capital city of Diega. As such, most wary nobles, wealthy merchants,
and high-ranking clergy employ their own private chefs to prepare their
meals. These Cocineras are held in high esteem not only for their
excellent cuisine -- renowned throughout Elara and beyond -- but also
for their loyalty to the people they serve. Who is better suited to keep
poisons away from an important person's plate, after all? A Cocinera
lives or dies on the trustworthiness of her reputation, and she'd really
rather live than die.

#### The Theologian

The theologians in Cordera, center of the Asrian faith, all agree on one
thing: the other theologians are wrong. Cloistered in their numerous
seminaries around the holy city, the students, teachers, and scholars
all believe very strongly in their faith, but argue incessantly over the
finest of details, incomprehensible to even well-educated laity.

These arguments often spill over into brawling fights, but as swords and
guns are not allowed on the seminary grounds, the religious scholars
instead conduct ritualized duels with knives hidden within their robes.
Such knife-fights are, by tradition, rarely fatal; most theologians bear
numerous scars on their hands and arms.
