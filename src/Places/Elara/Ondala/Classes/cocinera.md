#### The Cocinera

Intrigue and betrayal are a national pastime in Ondala, particularly in
the capital city of Diega. As such, most wary nobles, wealthy merchants,
and high-ranking clergy employ their own private chefs to prepare their
meals. These Cocineras are held in high esteem not only for their
excellent cuisine -- renowned throughout Elara and beyond -- but also
for their loyalty to the people they serve. Who is better suited to keep
poisons away from an important person's plate, after all? A Cocinera
lives or dies on the trustworthiness of her reputation, and she'd really
rather live than die.
