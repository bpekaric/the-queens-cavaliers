- **Albian Bulldog:** A breed of dog originally developed for the brutal sport of bull-baiting,
  most Albian bulldogs these days are rather mild in temperament except in defense of their
  owners. An owner can use the bulldog for a Brawl +1D6 Item Die in a fight.
  A purebred bulldog gives a +1D8 Item die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian Hunting Outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The traditional hunting outfit of Albia is
  designed along military lines coupled with practical gloves and boots for handling 
  dogs and riding horses. 

- **Albian Spaniel:** This hunting dog provides an Explore +1D6 Item Die 
  when tracking, moving, or foraging on the ground. When
  tracking an animal on the ground, this Item Die is maximized. A purebred
  Albian spaniel gives a +1D8 Item Die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian War Mastiff:** Albian war mastiffs are a large breed of dog that were extensively used during the 
  Twenty Years' War between Albia and Gallinea. They are strong dogs with powerful jaws that were used as guards 
  and trackers.

- **Frostwoven Apparel:** A frostwoven item requires one bolt of
  frostwoven fabric in addition to the normal cost of the clothing.
  Frostweaving is a Charm, and thus a frostwoven item cannot have an
  additional Charm added; however, a frostwoven item has no Item Die. For
  each frostwoven item worn, the wearer can withstand sub-freezing
  temperatures for 1 hour before feeling the ill effects of such. In
  addition, each item reduces the Drop penalty for cold weather by 1.

- **Greatbow:** Even larger than a standard longbow, an Albian greatbow
  requires more physical strength to use, but also provides a much longer
  effective range. It's less effective at close range, however.


Table: Albian Greatbow

| Weapon   | Hands Required | Prowess | Specialties | Ranges                                                         |
| :------- | :------------- | :------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Greatbow | Two            | Bow     | Aim         | Close (Drop 2), Short (Drop 0), Medium (Drop 0), Long (Drop 1) |

- **Hunting horn:** This horn is rarely used to play actual music, but instead is
  used for sending signals between hunters and their hunting hounds, usually in 
  fox hunting. A skilled huntsman can communicate over a range of up to one league.

- ***Orwand's Revelation:*** A book written by Dackin Orwand of Albia that claims Devra the Desert Mother and Ashra the Goddess-Empress are two 
  aspects of the same deity. Along with *The Books of the Sun* and *The Songs of the Desert Mother*, it is one of the holy books of Dualitarianism,
  and is specifically used to interpret those two books in accordance with Dualitarian theology. It provides a Scholarship +1D8 Item Die
  for topics related to Dualitarianism, and gives a Drop One penalty on rolls related to Asrianism or Devranism.

- **Pilgrim's Outfit:** The plain, ordinary clothes of the pilgrim are meant to
  convey a somber seriousness as well as humility. As such, it's almost unheard of
  for a pilgrim's outfit to be charmwoven, and nearly all are of neutral colors
  (white, brown, black, or grey).
