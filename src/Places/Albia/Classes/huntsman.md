#### The Huntsman

The hunters of Albia are known for their mounted hunting parties,
usually with the aid of hunting dogs such as the Albian spaniel. Bows
are the traditional weapons of choice for the hunt, but many in recent
centuries have shifted over to using firearms.

Many huntsmen of the lower social ranks hunt for food or for a
profession, while those from the nobility hunt for sport and for
bragging ranks.
