### Heroes of Northern Ifran

\#\# blurb

#### The Stargazer

Worship of Devra, the Desert Mother, centers on her role as queen of the
night. The goddess is represented as the moon, while the stars are said
to represent the spirits of departed ancestors who have gone before into
the dark. This emphasis on the night skies has led Devrans to develop
skills at astronomy far surpassing those of the sun-focused Asrians. 

Most of these Stargazers are found in the northern Ifran city of Ubar,
whose skylines is dominated by tall observatory towers that reach into
the night. Within these towers can be found Stargazers focused on
astronomical science; on reading the omens in the movements of the
stars; on the development of optics and lenses; on navigation in land,
sea, and sky; and other heavenly pursuits.

#### The Faris

The nomadic riders of the Ifrani desert travel between Ubar, Pitdah,
Aad, and other settlements and oases, in tribal groups. A mounted
warrior from one of these tribes is known as a faris, whether they ride
a horse or a camel. The nearest equivalent in Elara would be a knight or
chevalier, as another type of mounted combatant.

Far from being desert savages, a Faris is a well-mannered, educated
equestrian or cameleer, trained in matters of etiquette and peace as
well as war. A number of Faris have settled in or nearby Pitdah where
they serve as light cavalry for the khedive -- himself a former Faris --
and guards for caravans though the desert wastes.
