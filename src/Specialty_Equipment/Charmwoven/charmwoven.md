## The Nine Laws of Fashion

Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also
made according to exacting standards known as Gallinea's Nine Laws of
Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to
work at all !

While these are known as "Gallinea's" Laws, that's not because they're
enforced by the Queen's decree or by some sort of "fashion police" that
stalks the streets of Lutetia. Instead, these are akin to natural Laws
that were first noticed and codified in Gallinea; they simply describe
how things are rather than how they should be.

The First is the simplest Law:

### The First Law: The Law of Couture

*"One's clothes must fit properly."*

It seems obvious at first -- clothing is meant to be worn and to fit
properly ! But it's also the most important. If your clothes aren't
sized correctly for you, none of the charms will function. In addition,
each off-size article of clothing you wear adds a Drop 1 penalty to
combat actions if it's too large or too small.

To ensure your clothes are properly sized, you can't just buy your
clothes off the rack; the people of Gallinea are a diverse group when it
comes to body size, and there are no "standard sizes". Your clothes will
need to be either be created specifically for you, or altered by a
tailor. Only then can charms be effectively added to such apparel.

### The Second Law: The Law of Attunement

*"Charms are unique to the wearer."*

You can't just pick up any random charmwoven item and put it on, even if
it fits you. The patterns, glyphs, and trinkets sewn into charmwoven
clothing have to be calibrated for each wearers. This is a pretty simple
process -- as long as the charmweaver knows your birth date, birth time,
and place of birth. It usually takes about an hour to attune or reattune
charms to any given person.

What if you don't know some or any of that information to tell your
charmweaver? There are two options.

First, your charmweaver can attempt to adjust the charms to you anyway,
through trial and error. This takes one hour per piece of information
about your birth that you're missing. At the end of that process, the
charmweaver makes a simple Magicks (Weave) roll with the opposition pool
based on how much they don't know, as shown on the following
table.

Table: Opposition Pool for Charm Attunement Rolls

| Die | Birth Date           | Birth Time          | Place of Birth           |
| --- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| D0  | Exact date           | Time, to the minute | City or village of birth |
| D6  | Year and month known | Time, to the hour   | Province of birth        |
| D8  | Month known          | Morning or Night    | Country of birth         |
| D10 | Year known           |  --                 | Continent of birth       |
| D12 | Nothing known        | Nothing known       | Nothing known            |

The dice pool is based on all of these factors -- so if you know the
exact date of your birth, that you know you were born in the morning,
and that you were born somewhere in Talania, that's an opposition pool
of 1D0+1D8+1D8, or 2D8. As it's a simple check, the charmweaver needs
just one success point to correctly attune the item. On a failed check,
the charmweaver needs to start over again to attune the item.

The second option involves the use of Magicks (Portents), and for this
reason many charmweavers either work with those who can read omens, or
can do so themselves. 

The opposition pool for the Portents roll is the same as the pool
calculated above for the trial-and-error method using the Magicks
(Weave) specialty, but this is a standard roll not a simple roll. It
takes one minute to perform this type of reading, the portent-reader
must see you the entire time, and you must be willing to have it done.
Each success point spent reveals either your birth date, your birth time
to the minute, or your city or village of birth.

### The Third Law: The Law of Pertinence

*"The charm must correspond to the article."*

Simply stated, this means that a charm can only be applied to an item
that has some relationship to the type of enchantment desired.

For example, gloves for soldiers can be given charms that assist with
Dueling or Military (Aim), while gloves for craftsmen can be charmed for
Magicks, Medicine, or Science.

Pertinent skills for any given type of clothing are found later in this chapter
<a href="#creating-charmwoven-clothing" class="xref-insection"></a>,
which also summarizes which types of charms can be applied to which pieces of attire.

### The Fourth Law: The Law of Dissonance

*"Dissonance limits the effectiveness of charms."*

| Dissonance Level | Maximum Charm Die |
| :--------------- | :---------------- |
| 0                | No limits         |

### Head Apparel

Gallineans wear many different kinds of hats, with a type of headwear
available to every type of charm -- all the skills, with the exception
of Initiative. The types of hats available are shown in the following
table.

Table: Head Apparel

**Beret, Artisan's:** The simple woolen beret is common among crafters
in Gallinea. You can get a beret in many different colors, although
beret colors have extra significance within Lutetian society. Each craft
guild claims ownership of a particular, exacting shade of blue, green,
or red, and will object strenuously to anyone unaffiliated wearing
"their" colors. To those outside of the Lutetian guilds, the
distinctions between beret colors is almost entirely opaque.

**Capotain:** A capotain is a tall hat, usually flat on the top, with a
narrow brim. It originated in Albia and has since spread to Gallinea,
usually worn by the soldiery. Most capotains are black in color, and
many sport buckles in front -- although Albian purists claim that such a
frivolity is inauthentic and typical of Gallinea's love of decoration
for its own sake. 

**Cavalier Hat:** Made famous by the Queen's cavaliers but worn
throughout Gallinea, cavalier hats have a wide brim and are usually worn
with one side pinned up. A dyed ostrich feather is often added, both for
appearance's sake and to allow all-black hats to take a charm. Sometimes
these hats are colloquially referred to as neversettes.

**Goggles, Gearspring:** These goggles are created and used by
mechanicians as well as other crafters. Each set of goggles has two or
more pairs of lenses that can be swapped in as necessary -- functions
include magnification of small objects, telescopic sighting of distant
objects, filters for specific colors, or simple eye protection.
Gearspring goggles offer a +1D6 Item Die on Observation (Perception)
rolls.

**Hair Ribbons:** Magickally charmed hair ribbons are popular with the
upper classes and are woven into the hairstyles -- or wigs -- of any
gender of noble. Unless affixed to a wig (which must be one of the
neutral colors of argent, brunâtre, cendree, or sable), the ribbons
require anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to weave into hair,
or double that time if forced to don them without the help of a capable
household servant.

**Masque:** Not a bandanna clumsily worn by a common brigand to disguise
her identity, a masque actually does little to hide one's appearance.
Used by the nobility at their lavish parties, each is custom created to
reflect the wearer's persona and opinions of herself. Many masques only
encircle the eyes and the space between them, while others cover the
entire face. A Gallinean holiday called the Festival of Masques
celebrates freedoms, including sexual freedoms, and is a time when
nobles and non-nobles alike don masques to participate in the revelry.

**Plague Mask:** Part of a chirurgeon's standard surgical wear, a plague
mask is usually styled like a bird's long beak, although other examples
exist, such as long tusks or simply a cylinder. Goggles built into the
mask provide covering for the chirurgeon's eyes, while medicinal herbs
and complex filters in the "nose" cavity prevent infection of
air-carried diseases.

**Skullcap, Clerical:** Sometimes called calottes, these skullcaps are
associated with the Asrian religion and worn by its chaplains.
Lower-ranking priests of Eserre wear celeste, azure, vert, or brunâtre
skullcaps, while those higher in the order cover their skulls with
calottes of argent, carnation, or purpure. Only those clergy appointed
as Guardians of the Faith are allowed to wear Or skullcaps, with the
golden yellow color symbolizing their connection to the sun goddess. Lay
workers within the church are free to wear sable or cendree calottes
while performing church duties.

**Tricorne:** These felt hats have wide brims like cavalier hats, but
are pinned up on the sides and backs, forming them into triangular
shapes. In Gallinea and Albia it's traditional to wear the tricorne with
the single point facing forward, and in Ekalia and Dragosa to wear it
pointing back. Tricornes are most popular among sailors and members of
the military, with officers using them to display medals and other
symbols of rank.

### Shoulder Apparel

Shoulder charms tend to be about skills that are flashy and
attention-getting, although a few have use in disguising or hiding the
wearer.
