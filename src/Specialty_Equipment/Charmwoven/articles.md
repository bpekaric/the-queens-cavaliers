## Head Apparel

Gallineans wear many different kinds of hats, with a type of headwear
available to every type of charm -- all the skills, with the exception
of Initiative. The types of hats available are shown in the following
table.

**Beret, Artisan's:** The simple woolen beret is common among crafters
in Gallinea. You can get a beret in many different colors, although
beret colors have extra significance within Lutetian society. Each craft
guild claims ownership of a particular, exacting shade of blue, green,
or red, and will object strenuously to anyone unaffiliated wearing
"their" colors. To those outside of the Lutetian guilds, the
distinctions between beret colors is almost entirely opaque.

**Capotain:** A capotain is a tall hat, usually flat on the top, with a
narrow brim. It originated in Albia and has since spread to Gallinea,
usually worn by the soldiery. Most capotains are black in color, and
many sport buckles in front -- although Albian purists claim that such a
frivolity is inauthentic and typical of Gallinea's love of decoration
for its own sake. 

**Cavalier Hat:** Made famous by the Queen's cavaliers but worn
throughout Gallinea, cavalier hats have a wide brim and are usually worn
with one side pinned up. A dyed ostrich feather is often added, both for
appearance's sake and to allow all-black hats to take a charm. Sometimes
these hats are colloquially referred to as neversettes.

**Goggles, Gearspring:** These goggles are created and used by
mechanicians as well as other crafters. Each set of goggles has two or
more pairs of lenses that can be swapped in as necessary -- functions
include magnification of small objects, telescopic sighting of distant
objects, filters for specific colors, or simple eye protection.
Gearspring goggles offer a +1D6 Item Die on Observation (Perception)
rolls.

**Hair Ribbons:** Magickally charmed hair ribbons are popular with the
upper classes and are woven into the hairstyles -- or wigs -- of any
gender of noble. Unless affixed to a wig (which must be one of the
neutral colors of argent, brunâtre, cendree, or sable), the ribbons
require anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to weave into hair,
or double that time if forced to don them without the help of a capable
household servant.

**Masque:** Not a bandanna clumsily worn by a common brigand to disguise
her identity, a masque actually does little to hide one's appearance.
Used by the nobility at their lavish parties, each is custom created to
reflect the wearer's persona and opinions of herself. Many masques only
encircle the eyes and the space between them, while others cover the
entire face. A Gallinean holiday called the Festival of Masques
celebrates freedoms, including sexual freedoms, and is a time when
nobles and non-nobles alike don masques to participate in the revelry.

**Plague Mask:** Part of a chirurgeon's standard surgical wear, a plague
mask is usually styled like a bird's long beak, although other examples
exist, such as long tusks or simply a cylinder. Goggles built into the
mask provide covering for the chirurgeon's eyes, while medicinal herbs
and complex filters in the "nose" cavity prevent infection of
air-carried diseases.

**Skullcap, Clerical:** Sometimes called calottes, these skullcaps are
associated with the Asrian religion and worn by its chaplains.
Lower-ranking priests of Eserre wear celeste, azure, vert, or brunâtre
skullcaps, while those higher in the order cover their skulls with
calottes of argent, carnation, or purpure. Only those clergy appointed
as Guardians of the Faith are allowed to wear Or skullcaps, with the
golden yellow color symbolizing their connection to the sun goddess. Lay
workers within the church are free to wear sable or cendree calottes
while performing church duties.

**Tricorne:** These felt hats have wide brims like cavalier hats, but
are pinned up on the sides and backs, forming them into triangular
shapes. In Gallinea and Albia it's traditional to wear the tricorne with
the single point facing forward, and in Ekalia and Dragosa to wear it
pointing back. Tricornes are most popular among sailors and members of
the military, with officers using them to display medals and other
symbols of rank.

## Shoulder Apparel

Shoulder charms tend to be about skills that are flashy and
attention-getting, although a few have use in disguising or hiding the
wearer.
