# Articulation Component

::::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Clockwork devices are inherently clumsy; if used as replacements for a
human's natural ability, they take a Drop 4 penalty on associated
actions. This is primarily the case when someone replaces part of her
body with a clockwork limb, such as an arm or a leg. The articulation
component reduces those penalties from Drop 4 down to Drop 2, Drop 1 or
Drop 0.

**Creating an Articulation Component:** The Medicine (Surgery) specialty is
required to create an articulation component with a low Drop penalty.
Surgery +1 is required for Drop 1, and Surgery +2 for Drop 0.

**Power Requirements:** Articulation components don't themselves require a
power source, as they are usually attached to powered components.

| Space | Cost  | Supplies | Penalty  | Prerequisite |
| :---: | :---: | :------: | :------: | :----------: |
| 0     | 1D0   | 0 gears  | Drop 4   |              |
| 1     | 1D0   | 0 gears  | Drop 2   |              |
| 2     | 1D0   | 0 gears  | Drop 1   | Surgery +1   |
| 0     | 1D6   | 1 gear   | Drop 2   |              |
| 1     | 1D6   | 1 gear   | Drop 1   | Surgery +1   |
| 2     | 1D6   | 1 gear   | Drop 0   | Surgery +2   |
| 0     | 1D8   | 2 gears  | Drop 1   | Surgery +1   |
| 1     | 1D8   | 2 gears  | Drop 0   | Surgery +2   |
