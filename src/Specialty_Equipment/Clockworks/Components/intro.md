# Components

Components provide the basic functionality of a clockwork device, and
are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing, by how much
power require to run, and by the effects the component can produce.

**Purchasing a Component:** A component can be purchased, pre-assembled, for
the cost shown on the table for that component type. The availability is
equal to the highest cost die of the component.

**Constructing a Component:** Unless otherwise specified, a component can be
constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear supplies as
shown on the table for that component, and at least four hours' work. At
the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each
success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth of
gear supplies to construct components or power sources.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a
component is limited to her number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with +3 Science (Clockworks)
can only spend 3 gears on creating a movement component.

**Component Notation:** A power source is described by listing the name of
the power source followed by the space, power requirements, and other
qualities of the component. Examples: articulation (space 1, power 0,
Drop 1); carry (space 2, power 1, person); projectile weapon (space 3,
power 1, weapon die d8, close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 0, long
Drop 2).
