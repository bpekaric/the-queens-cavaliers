# Miniaturization Component

The miniaturization component doesn't actually add any capabilities to a
device, but it makes it easier to fit more into the casing of the
device. The component makes space in the device by reducing the size of
existing components; this is reflected by additional gear space that is
added to that of the casing.

**Unique Component:** A device can have only one miniaturization component.

**Space:** A miniaturization component does not take up space in a device.

**Power:** A miniaturization component does not require power.
