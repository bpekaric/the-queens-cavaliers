# Efficiency Component

:::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The efficiency component reduces the time necessary to do a simple,
repetitive task. For combined actions, this reduces the Drop penalty by
1, 2 or 4 â€“ but with a minimum of Drop 1. For other repetitive tasks
this reduces the time needed to complete those tasks, through mechanical
automation. For example, a mechanized loom could cut in half the time
needed to produce simple cloth.

An efficiency component cannot reduce the time of complex tasks that
involve specialty rolls, such as charmweaving or surgery.

Table: Efficiency Component

| Space | Cost  | Supplies | Power | Drop Reduction   | Time Reduction     |
| :---: | :---: | :------: | :---: | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| 1     | 1D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 1 | Reduce Time by 10% |
| 2     | 1D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Reduce Drop by 2 | Reduce Time by 25% | 
| 4     | 1D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 4 | Reduce Time by 50% |
| 8     | 1D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | --               | Reduce Time by 75% |
| 16    | 1D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | --               | Reduce Time by 90% |
