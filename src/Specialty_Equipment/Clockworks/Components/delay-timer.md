# Delay Timer Component

A delay timer prevents a power source from providing power to a device
until a fixed amount of time has passed. To use the delay trigger
component, first it must be armed and the length of delay set. The delay
durations shown are not randomly determined but are set by the user,
although each with a set range has a minimum of one time unit.

Delay timers are most frequently used with blackpowder flintlock or
tension trigger power sources, and often trigger projectile weapon traps
or bombs.

**Power:** Delay timers don't require additional power to operate.

**Combined Timers:** If you want to extend the delay duration with more
detail, you will need to have two or more delay components with a duration
of 1 Turn or more. The arming time is equal to the sum of each delay timer's
arming time.

For example, if you wish to have a bomb explode after 33 minutes, you will
need three delay timers with a total cost of 3D8 and an arming time of 
3 Turns. To have a timer that goes off after 2 hours and 10 minutes, you
will need two delay timers with a total cost of 1D10+1D8 and an arming
time of 1 minute and 1 turn.

**Calculation Components:** If you need even more precise time control over 
the timing, you may want to install a Calculcation Component instead.
