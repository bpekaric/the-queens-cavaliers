# Measurement Component

The measurement component allows a device to take a reading of the
physical environment around it. By default, this is displayed on the
device in some way. Examples of qualities that can be measured include
the temperature, barometric pressure, altitude, longitude and latitude,
velocity, oceanic depth, compass directions, sound levels, and more. A
worn device could measure the wearer's speed, heart rate, or blood
pressure.

A measurement component is often tied to a calculation component to
allow the device to process the information that it measures.
