**Roll:** The device moves at half speed when not on a road or other flat surface.

**Climb:** The device can move up and down vertically.

**Step:** The device can walk like a human or animal. This requires at least one Articulation Component.

**Glide:** The device must maintain at least Walk speed in order to stay aloft. Note that Glide components use less power than most other Movement Components.

**Float:** The device is a boat or ship and can travel on the surface of the water.

**Submerge:** In addition to being able to float on the surface of the water, the device can go beneath the waves like a submersible. 

**Fly:** The device can fly through the air. Unless it is powered by a Phlogistone Furnace, the device must maintain a minimum of Walk speed in order to stay aloft.
