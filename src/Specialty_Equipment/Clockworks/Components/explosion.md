# Explosion Component

This component produces a loud and potentially deadly explosion. It's
used in creating bombs or grenades.

**Power Requirement:** An explosion component can only be powered by a
blackpowder flintlock or an alchemical capacitor. Note that blackpowder
flintlocks are a lot more effective at powering an explosion than an
alchemical capacitor.

**Environmental Damage:** An explosion does damage to everything inside a
given area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent areas,
and even targets up to 2 areas away for the most powerful explosions.
This environmental damage inflicts one yield for one success point, and
one wound for three success points.

**Self-Destruction:** Upon use, the device is destroyed by the force of its
own explosion.

**Creating an Explosion Component:** The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create an explosion component and it requires the use of
blackpowder supplies to do so. The maximum number of blackpowder
supplies that can be spent to create an explosion component is equal to
the powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).
