# Calculation

The calculation component gives the device the ability to compute
certain values when given appropriate information. The simplest form of
calculation is simple timekeeping; nearly any clockwork device can be
made to function as a clock.

More advanced calculations can compute the calendar date (including holy
days and stellar phenomenon), plot out a navigation course, do complex
polynomial math such as ballistics, or even do relatively complex
analytical analysis.

Unless the device has the measurement component, it is reliant upon user
input for all appropriate information, such as the longitude and
latitude, the weather conditions, and so on. Faulty data can lead to
faulty calculations.

**Creating a Calculation Component:** The Science (Calculus) specialty is
required to create a calculation component and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a calculation component is equal to the creator's
ranks in Science (Calculus).
