# Clockwork Weapon Component

A Clockwork Weapon is a melee weapon that has been modified with moving
parts to make it even more deadly â€“ for example, a rotating flail or a
chain-toothed sword. The Clockwork Weapon component grants a bonus die
that can be used whenever the device's Weapon Die is used, including
Defense (Parry) rolls and Dueling rolls.

**Size Limit:** A device with the Clockwork Weapon component can be no larger
than Portable size.

**Requires Dueling Weapon:** You can only add this component to a
device if it already possesses the Dueling Weapon component. The
Clockwork Weapon Bonus Die cannot exceed the Weapon Die of the device.
