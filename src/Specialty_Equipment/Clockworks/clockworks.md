## Clockwork Devices

Each device consists of the following:

- 1 Casing
- 1 or more Power Sources
- 1 or more Components

**Gear Space:** Each casing has a certain amount of gear space available,
depending upon its size. The power source and the components use up that
space once installed. A miniaturization component can be installed in a
casing to increase its effective gear space.

**Power:** Each power source delivers a set amount of power, dependent on
the type of power source and the method of producing that power. Each
component consumes a specified amount of power, and the power source's
output must be enough to cover the power used by the components. Power
is measured in power units.

**Complexity:** The complexity of a device is equal to the number of power
sources plus the number of components.

## Constructing a Device

**Note: These rules are obsolute and this section needs to be rewritten to 
reflect the current crafting rules.**

There are five steps to creating a device:

1. Plan the Device
2. Purchase the Supplies
3. Build the Parts
4. Install the Parts
5. Complete the Device

### Plan the Device

Before you start, you should plan out what you want your device to do.
Decide how large the device will be – the size of its casing. Determine
what capabilities it will have by the components you choose to install,
and make sure that you have a strong enough power source to provide
power to those components.

Once you have the device planned out, you can spend four hours to make a
Science (Calculus) roll to draft a set of plans for building the device.
This is optional, but is highly recommended as it gives you an
additional die to roll when installing parts in your device and
completing it. 

The difficulty of the Science (Calculus) roll to draw plans is
determined by the complexity of the device you are designing, as shown
on the table below. 

Table: Device Complexity

| Device Complexity | Standard Opposition   |
| :---------------: | :-------------------- |
| 2                 | Easy (3D6)            |
| 3 – 4             | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 5 – 8             | Hard (3D10)           |
| 9+                | Very Difficult (3D12) |

If you earn at least two success points on the Science (Calculus) roll,
you have successfully drawn plans that will give you (or anyone else who
follows them) a D6 bonus on rolls to install and complete the device.
For each additional two success points you spend, you can increase the
size of that die up to a maximum limited by your ranks in Science
(Calculus), as shown below.

Table: Maximum Die

| Calculus Ranks | Maximum Die |
| :------------: | :---------: |
| +1             | D6          |
| +2             | D8          |
| +3             | D10         |
| +4             | D12         |
| +5             | D12         |

**Prototype:** If you have an existing prototype for the device, either
created by yourself or by someone else, you gain a bonus D6 die on the
roll to draw plans. The prototype does not need to be currently
functional for you to gain this bonus.

### Purchase the Supplies

There are three ways to acquire the parts needed for constructing a
device: build them yourself, buy them from another clockworker, or
salvage the parts from another device.

If you are going to build your own parts, you will need to buy gear
supplies. Make a Wealth roll against the cost and availability of gear
supplies – D8 for the cost, and D6 availability unless you are in a
large city (in which case the availability is D0). Each success point on
the Wealth roll enables you to buy one unit of gear supplies since they
are a bulk item.

If you are going to buy certain parts, you will also make a Wealth roll
based on the cost of the part (casing, power source, or component) that
you wish to purchase. The cost for each is listed in the descriptions of
each part later in this chapter. A casing has an availability of D0,
while power sources and components have an availability equal to the
highest die of their costs.

For details on salvaging parts and supplies, see the later section on
Salvage.

### Build the Parts

You can save money by building your own casing, although this does
consume more time. A roll is not necessary, although you must have
competency in the Science (Clockworks) specialty to construct a usable
casing. See the later section on Constructing a Power Source for more
information.

Building a power source or a component requires a number of gear
supplies as shown on the table for that part, and at least four hours'
work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for
each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth
of gear supplies to create components or power sources. Multiple rolls
may be required to create all the parts needed for a complex device.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that you can spend on a single
part is limited to your number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). 

**Standard Opposition:** The difficulty for this roll is Easy (3D6) if you
are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not.

**Tools:**If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** The plans for the overall device do not apply on this roll.

**Prototype:** You gain no bonus for having a prototype of the device when
making this roll.

### Install the Parts

Installing a power source or component in a casing requires a Science
(Clockworks) roll (or series of rolls). The difficulty is Easy (3D6) if
you are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not. Each roll takes
four hours, and each success point installs one power source or
component.

**Tools:** If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** If you have plans for the device, you gain a bonus die based on
the quality of the plans when making this roll.

**Prototype:** If you have a prototype of the device, you gain a bonus D6
die on this roll. The prototype does not need to be currently functional
for you to gain this bonus.

### Complete the Device

Once all the components have been successfully installed, the device
needs to be completed. This requires no roll, but does require one hour
of work per point of complexity of the device. 

## Casings

Casings are measured by their physical size, which determines the amount
of gear space within the casing.

**Purchasing a Casing:** Casings are either purchased at the cost shown
below or constructed by the clockworker for no cost. The availability of
a casing is always D0. Gear supplies cannot be spent on casing costs.

**Creating a Casing:** It takes one hour per point of Gear Space to create a
casing. No skill roll is required, but the clockworker must have at
least one rank in the Clockworks specialty.

**Casing Notation:** A casing is described by listing the size of the casing
followed by the gear space of that casing in parentheses. Examples:
pocket (space 1), person (space 8), building (space 64).

Table: Casings 

| Casing Size | Cost | Gear Space |
| :---------- | :--: | :--------: |
| Pocket      | D0   | 1          |
| Handheld    | D0   | 2          |
| Portable    | D6   | 4          |
| Person      | D6   | 8          |
| Carriage    | D8   | 16         |
| Room        | D10  | 32         |
| Building    | D12  | 64         |

#### Pocket Size

A pocket-sized device is easily concealed, requires only one hand to
operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing.
Examples include pocketwatches and wrist holsters.

#### Handheld Size

A handheld device requires usually requires one hand to operate and can
be carried on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Examples include
clockwork pistols and gearswords.

#### Portable Size

A portable device is one which requires two hands to carry and operate,
or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Most don't need to be
self-mobile. Examples include clockwork muskets and wing-gliders.

#### Person Size

An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue – can't be
easily carried by a single person without requiring her full attention.
Most are therefore either stationary devices or self-mobile. Examples
include humanoid automata and velocipedes.

#### Carriage Size

Larger than a human but smaller than a room, carriage-sized devices are
on the scale of large pieces of furniture. Unless self-mobile, they
require several people in order to transport. Examples include clockwork
carriages and some industrial machines.

#### Room Size

Room-sized devices take up the entire space of a sizable room, and are
therefore rarely portable unless self-mobile. Examples include some
analytical engines and most watermills.

#### Building Size

Devices the size of a building are usually as large as a two or three
story building with a half-dozen rooms. Examples include airships and
clock towers.

## Power Sources

Power sources are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing,
by how much power they can provide, and by how that power is activated
to enable components.

**Purchasing a Power Source:** A power source can be purchased,
pre-assembled, for the cost shown on the table for that power source.
The availability is equal to the highest cost die of the power source.

**Constructing a Power Source:** Unless otherwise specified, a power source
can be constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear
supplies as shown on the table for that power source, and at least four
hours' work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll
and for each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's
worth of gear supplies.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a
single power source is limited to her number of specialty ranks in
Science (Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with Science
(Clockworks) +3 can only spend 3 gears on creating a mainspring power
source.

*Note:* There are a few power sources that cannot be constructed using the
Clockworks specialty. This will be noted in the description of the power
source along with information about the required skill for construction.
The roll is otherwise treated like the Clockworks specialty roll.

**Power Source Notation:** A power source is described by listing the name
of the power source followed by the space, power supply, other qualities
of the power source, and the duration. Examples: gear train (space 1,
power supply 2, Drop 1, one action); mainspring (space 4, power supply
4, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes); tension trigger (space 1, power
supply 2, reset Drop 2, one use). 

#### Alchemical Capacitor

An alchemical capacitor is a simple jar device that is used to generate,
capture, and store electrical energy through alchemical means. A crude
electromechanical interface allows the energy of the capacitor to be
released and used over an extended period of time.

Each alchemical capacitor functions for 24 hours before needing to be
replaced and reinstalled in a device. The power supply's duration is the
same if it is used once during that time period or used repeatedly.

**Creating an Alchemical Capacitor:** The Magicks (Brew) specialty is
required to create an alchemical capacitor, and it requires the use of
alchemical supplies to do so. The maximum number of alchemical supplies
that can be spent to create an alchemical capacitor is equal to the
brewer's ranks in Magicks (Brew).

Table: Alchemical Capacitor Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power Supplied | Duration |
| :---: | :--- | :-------------------: | :------------: | :------: |
| 2     | D6   | 1 alchemical supplies | 1              | 24 Hours |
| 4     | D8   | 2 alchemical supplies | 2              | 24 Hours |
| 8     | D10  | 3 alchemical supplies | 3              | 24 Hours |
| 16    | D12  | 4 alchemical supplies | 4              | 24 Hours |

#### Gear Train

A gear train is used to transmit mechanical energy to a device as part
of the same action that uses the device; this mechanical energy is
supplied by the muscular activity of the device's user. This activity is
a combined action that imposes a Drop 4 to Drop 0 penalty on that
action. The power thus supplied is only good for that specific action.

For example, a velocipede might have a Drop1 penalty required to provide
3 units of power, which can then be used to power the carry and movement
components of the velocipede. This imposes that Drop 1 penalty on
actions undertaken by the rider of the velocipede during the turn in
which it's ridden.

**Variable Gear Train:** The power units and the drop penalty of any given
gear train are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A gear train
(space 0, power supply 2, Drop 2) will always supply 2 power units and
require a Drop 2 penalty to operate. However, a gear train can be made
variable by increasing the space by 1 and the cost by D6 (1 gear); this
allows variable power supply based on the amount of Drop penalty taken
to power it. For example, a variable gear train (space 0+1, power supply
1/2/3, Drop 1/2/4) supplies 1 power unit if a Drop 1 penalty is applied,
2 power units for a Drop 2 penalty, and 3 power units for a Drop 4
penalty.

Table: Gear Train Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies   | Power Supplied | Drop   | Duration   |
| :---: | :--: | :--------: | :------------: | :----: | :--------: | 
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 1              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 2              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 1              | Drop 4 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 1              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 2              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 3              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 4              | Drop 4 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 2              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 3              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 4              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears    | 3              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears    | 4              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears    | 4              | Drop 0 | One Action |

#### Blackpowder Flintlock

A blackpowder flintlock is a kind of trigger that fires off once, using
exploding blackpowder to provide energy to power the device's
components. After the blackpowder flintlock is triggered, it must be
reloaded with blackpowder and reset – a procedure which takes an amount
of time as shown on the table below.

Creating a Blackpowder Flintlock: The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create a blackpowder flintlock, and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a blackpowder flintlock is equal to the
powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Blackpowder Flintlock Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power Supplied | Reset   | Duration |
| :---: | :--: | :-------------------: | :------------: | :----:  | :------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 blackpowder charges | 2              | Drop 1  | One use  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 blackpowder charge  | 4              | Drop 2  | One use  |
| 2     | D8   | 2 blackpowder charges | 6              | Drop 4  | One use  |
| 3     | D10  | 3 blackpowder charges | 8              | 2 Turns | One use  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 blackpowder charges | 10             | 3 Turns | One use  |

#### Mainspring

A mainspring is a complex clockwork spring used to store power until it
needs to be released. The initial power is put into the mainspring by
winding it and then is released by a mechanical flywheel.

The capabilities of a mainspring are measured in both how much power is
provided and how that power is stored and released; each factor is
purchased separately as shown on the tables below. To design a
mainspring, you need to determine both the power output and the duration
separately, paying the cost (in wealth rolls or gear supplies) for each.

A mainspring can't be wound for more than 10 minutes; at that point, the
mainspring is holding the full amount of power that it is able to store
and release.

**One Turn Winding/One Use per Success Point Duration:** If the winding time
is one turn and the duration is one use per success point, make a
Science (Clockworks) check against Easy (3D6) standard difficulty. Each
success point grants one use of the device before the end of the scene.

**Variable Mainspring:** The winding time and duration any given mainspring
are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A mainspring (space 1,
power supply 1, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes) will always require
1 minute of winding and provide 10 minutes of power. However, a
mainspring can be made variable by increasing the space by 1 and the
cost by D6 (1 gear); this allows variable duration based on the amount
of time spent winding it. For example, a variable mainspring (space 1+1,
power supply 1, wind 1 turn/1 minute/10 minutes, duration 1 minute/10
minutes/1 hour) supplies power for 1 minute if wound for 1 turn, 10
minutes if wound for 1 minute, and 1 hour if wound for 10 minutes.

Table: Mainspring  Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1              |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 2              |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 4              |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 6              |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 8              |

Table: Mainspring Options Power Source

#### Naturalistic Turbine

A naturalistic turbine is one that is hooked up to a source of power
that exists in the natural world – running water, winds, or tidal flow.
Naturalistic turbines produce a steady but low amount of power, without
requiring any special actions or fuel to make them function. Setting up
a naturalistic turbine to use any given natural energy supply requires
one hour per power unit produced, so most are installed in permanent
locations such as windmills or watermills.

**Natural Limits:** A stream can produce up to 2 power units, while larger
rivers can supply up to 4. Wind power varies between 0 and 3 power units
in most situations. Tidal flow usually only can provide 1 power unit.

**Sails:** A sail takes up half the space of a normal naturalistic turbine,
but the power supplied can only be used for movement. It also requires
the purchase of one unit of fabric supplies per power unit.

Table: Naturalistic Turbine Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1              |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2              |
| 6     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3              |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4              |

#### Phlogistone Furnace

A phlogistone furnace burns the rare mineral phlogistone to use for
generating lift and propulsion. It is primarily used in airships and can
be prohibitively expensive for other uses.

**Limited Power:** Power units produced by a phlogistone furnace can only be
used to power carry and movement components.

**Envelope:** A charmwoven cloth envelope is necessary for use with a
phlogistone furnace; this requires the skills of a charmweaver with at
least 4 specialty ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Fuel:** Each hour that a phlogistone furnace is in use, it burns one pound
of phlogistone per power unit supplied. The amount of power supplied can
be reduced by burning lesser quantities of phlogistone.

**Creating a Phlogistone Furnace:** The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create a phlogistone furnace, and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a phlogistone furnace is equal to the powderworker's
ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Phlogistone Furnace Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied              | Envelope Cost | Envelope Supplies |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :-------------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 10 (carry or movement only) | D10           | 4 fabric          |
| 6     | 2D12 | 5 gears  | 20 (carry or movement only) | D12           | 5 fabric          |

#### Tension Trigger

A tension trigger stores energy for use and then releases it. To reset a
tension trigger, you need to take a reset action, which is a combined
action with a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4. Unlike gear trains, tension
triggers store energy for future use rather than immediate use, but
unlike mainsprings a tension trigger will only store that energy for a
single use.

Table: Tension Trigger Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied | Reset  | Duration |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: | :----: | :------- |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1              | Drop 4 | One use  |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 2              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 3              | Drop 4 | One use  |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 1     | D12  | 4 gears  | 3              | Drop 1 | One use  |

## Components

Components provide the basic functionality of a clockwork device, and
are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing, by how much
power require to run, and by the effects the component can produce.

**Purchasing a Component:** A component can be purchased, pre-assembled, for
the cost shown on the table for that component type. The availability is
equal to the highest cost die of the component.

**Constructing a Component:** Unless otherwise specified, a component can be
constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear supplies as
shown on the table for that component, and at least four hours' work. At
the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each
success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth of
gear supplies to construct components or power sources.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a
component is limited to her number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with +3 Science (Clockworks)
can only spend 3 gears on creating a movement component.

**Component Notation:** A power source is described by listing the name of
the power source followed by the space, power requirements, and other
qualities of the component. Examples: articulation (space 1, power 0,
Drop 1); carry (space 2, power 1, person); projectile weapon (space 3,
power 1, weapon die d8, close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 0, long
Drop 2).

#### Armor

Armor plating protects both the device itself and anyone using or within
the device. The armor component grants an Armor Die that can be used for
Defense (Block) rolls.

Table: Armor Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Armor Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D0        |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | D6        |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | D8        |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | D10       |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | D12       |

#### Articulation

Clockwork devices are inherently clumsy; if used as replacements for a
human's natural ability, they take a Drop 4 penalty on associated
actions. This is primarily the case when someone replaces part of her
body with a clockwork limb, such as an arm or a leg. The articulation
component reduces those penalties from Drop 4 down to Drop 2, Drop 1 or
Drop 0.

**Creating an Articulation Component:** The Medicine (Surgery) specialty is
required to create an articulation component with a low Drop penalty.
Surgery +1 is required for Drop 1, and Surgery +2 for Drop 0.

Table: Articulation Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Penalty  |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 4   |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 2   |
| 2     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 1   |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | Drop 2   |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | Drop 1   |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | Drop 0   |
| 0     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | Drop 1   |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | Drop 0   |
| 0     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | Drop 0   |

#### Calculation

The calculation component gives the device the ability to compute
certain values when given appropriate information. The simplest form of
calculation is simple timekeeping; nearly any clockwork device can be
made to function as a clock.

More advanced calculations can compute the calendar date (including holy
days and stellar phenomenon), plot out a navigation course, do complex
polynomial math such as ballistics, or even do relatively complex
analytical analysis.

Unless the device has the measurement component, it is reliant upon user
input for all appropriate information, such as the longitude and
latitude, the weather conditions, and so on. Faulty data can lead to
faulty calculations.

**Creating a Calculation Component:** The Science (Calculus) specialty is
required to create a calculation component and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a calculation component is equal to the creator's
ranks in Science (Calculus).

Table: Calculation Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Calculation Complexity |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------------------- |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Timekeeping            |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Calendar               |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | Navigation             |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 1     | Polynomials            |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 1     | Analytics              |

#### Carry

The carry component gives a device the ability to lift additional
weight. Most devices with the movement component have enough carrying
capacity to lift themselves, including a normal load; some have even
greater capacity depending on their use.

Table: Carry Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Carrying Capacity |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :---------------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Pocket            |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Handheld          |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Portable          |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Person            |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | Carriage          |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 4     | Room              |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 8     | Building          |

#### Delay Timer

A delay timer prevents a power source from providing power to a device
until a fixed amount of time has passed. To use the delay trigger
component, first it must be armed and the length of delay set. The delay
durations shown are not randomly determined but are set by the user,
although each with a set range has a minimum of one time unit.

Delay timers are most frequently used with blackpowder flintlock or
tension trigger power sources, and often trigger projectile weapon traps
or bombs.

Table: Delay Timer Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Arm      | Delay Duration        |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------- | :-------------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 2   | End of current action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 1 Turn   | 1-10 Turns            |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 1 Turn   | 1-10 Minutes          |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 1 minute | 1-8 Hours             |
| 1     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 1 minute | 1-6 Days              |

#### Efficiency

The efficiency component reduces the time necessary to do a simple,
repetitive task. For combined actions, this reduces the Drop penalty by
1, 2 or 4 – but with a minimum of Drop 1. For other repetitive tasks
this reduces the time needed to complete those tasks, through mechanical
automation. For example, a mechanized loom could cut in half the time
needed to produce simple cloth.

An efficiency component cannot reduce the time of complex tasks that
involve specialty rolls, such as charmweaving or surgery.

Table: Efficiency Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Drop Reduction   | Time Reduction     |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 1 | Reduce Time by 10% |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Reduce Drop by 2 | Reduce Time by 25% | 
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 4 | Reduce Time by 50% |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | --               | Reduce Time by 75% |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | --               | Reduce Time by 90% |

#### Explosion

This component produces a loud and potentially deadly explosion. It's
used in creating bombs or grenades.

**Power Requirement:** An explosion component can only be powered by a
blackpowder flintlock or an alchemical capacitor. Note that blackpowder
flintlocks are a lot more effective at powering an explosion than an
alchemical capacitor.

**Environmental Damage:** An explosion does damage to everything inside a
given area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent areas,
and even targets up to 2 areas away for the most powerful explosions.
This environmental damage inflicts one yield for one success point, and
one wound for three success points.

**Self-Destruction:** Upon use, the device is destroyed by the force of its
own explosion.

**Creating an Explosion Component:** The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create an explosion component and it requires the use of
blackpowder supplies to do so. The maximum number of blackpowder
supplies that can be spent to create an explosion component is equal to
the powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Explosion Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power | Environmental Damage (1 area, 2 areas) |
| :---: | :--: | :-------------------: | :---: | :------------------------------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 1 blackpowder charge  | 2     | 3D6                                    |
| 1     | D6   | 2 blackpowder charges | 4     | 3D8                                    |
| 2     | D8   | 3 blackpowder charges | 6     | 3D10 (3D6)                             |
| 4     | D10  | 4 blackpowder charges | 8     | 3D12 (3D8)                             |
| 8     | D12  | 5 blackpowder charges | 10    | 5D12 (3D10, 3D6)                       |

#### Hand-to-Hand Weapon

The Hand-to-Hand Weapon component gives a device the ability to be used
as a weapon by granting it a Weapon Die, and assigning it a Weapon
Prowess category. Choose one option from each of the following tables to
define a complete Hand-to-Hand Weapon.

**Size Limit:** A device with the hand-to-hand weapon component can be no
larger than Portable size.

Table: Hand-to-Hand Weapon Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Weapon Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D6         |
| 2     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D8         |
| 4     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | D10        |
| 8     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | D12        |

Table: Hand-To-Hand Weapon Component Options

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Casing Size | Weapon Prowess | Max Weapon Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :---------- | :------------- | :------------: |
| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | +0    | Pocket      | Knife          | 1D6            |

| +1    | D0   | 0 gears  | +0    | Portable    | Sword          | 1D12           |
| +2    | D0   | 0 gears  | +0    | Portable    | Cudgel         | 1D12           |
| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | +0    | Portable    | Pike           | 1D12           |

#### Injector

The injector component gives a device the ability to inject a fluid,
such as an alchemical solution or a vial of poison, into a living
creature. A device can hold only one dose and it takes a Drop 4 action
to refill the device.

Using the device in a combat situation requires a Medicine (Poisons)
roll to deliver its payload.

Table: Injector Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     |

#### Item Die

The item die component allows you to add an Item Die for one specialty
to a device. For example, a spyglass could provide an Item Die on
Observation (Perceive) rolls, or a tricked-out screwdriver could provide
an Item Die on Science (Clockwork) rolls.

To provide a bonus to more than one specialty, add another Item Die
component for each additional specialty.

**Defense (Parry), Dueling:** Use the Hand-to-Hand Weapon component to add a
melee Weapon Die to a device.

**Defense (Block):** Use the Armor component to add an Armor Die to a device.

**Initiative:** These specialties can never benefit from an Item Die.

**Military (Aim):** Use the Projectile Weapon component to add a ranged Weapon Die to a device.

Table: Item Die Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Item Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D6       |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | D8       |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | D10      |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | D12      |

#### Magazine

A magazine component holds multiple shots of ammunition (bullets and
powder or quarrels, for example) for a device with the projectile weapon
component. The amount held in each magazine, and the time required to
reload the device with a full magazine, are shown in the table below.

Table: Magazine Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Shots | Reload    |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :---: | :-------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | 2     | Drop 4    |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 4     | Drop 4    |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 8     | 2 Turns   |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 16    | 3 Turns   |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 32    | 4 Turns   |

#### Measurement

The measurement component allows a device to take a reading of the
physical environment around it. By default, this is displayed on the
device in some way. Examples of qualities that can be measured include
the temperature, barometric pressure, altitude, longitude and latitude,
velocity, oceanic depth, compass directions, sound levels, and more. A
worn device could measure the wearer's speed, heart rate, or blood
pressure.

A measurement component is often tied to a calculation component to
allow the device to process the information that it measures.

Table: Measurement Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Qualities Measured |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :----------------: | 
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | 1                  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 1                  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | 2                  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 2                  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | 4                  |
| 2     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 4                  |
| 2     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | 8                  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 8                  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | 16                 |

#### Miniaturization

The miniaturization component doesn't actually add any capabilities to a
device, but it makes it easier to fit more into the casing of the
device. The component makes space in the device by reducing the size of
existing components; this is reflected by additional gear space that is
added to that of the casing.

**Unique Component:** A device can have only one miniaturization component.

Table: Miniaturization Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Additional Gear Space |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-------------------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | +1                    |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | +2                    |
| 0     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | +4                    |
| 0     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | +6                    |
| 0     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | +8                    |

#### Movement

The movement component gives the device the ability to move itself.

**Carry Component Required:** A device with a movement component must have a carry component of at least the same size as the device's casing.

**Roll:** The device moves at half speed when not on a road or other flat surface.

**Climb:** The device can move up and down vertically.

**Step:** The device can walk like a human or animal.

**Glide:** The device must maintain at least Walk speed in order to stay aloft.

**Float:** The device is a boat or ship and can travel on the surface of the water.

**Submerge:** In addition to being able to float on the surface of the water, the device can go beneath the waves like a submersible. 

**Fly:** The device can fly through the air. Unless it is powered by a Phlogistone Furnace, the device must maintain a minimum of Walk speed in order to stay aloft.

Table: Movement Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Walk    | Run     | Overland Speed      |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-----: | :-----: | :------------------ |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | 0 Areas | 1 Area  | 1 league per hour   |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | 1 Area  | 2 Areas | 3 leagues per hour  |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | 1 Area  | 3 Areas | 6 leagues per hour  |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3     | 1 Area  | 4 Areas | 10 leagues per hour |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | 1 Area  | 5 Areas | 15 leagues per hour |

Table: Movement Component Options

#### Powered Weapon

A powered weapon is a melee weapon that has been modified with moving
parts to make it even more deadly – for example, a rotating flail or a
chain-toothed sword. The powered weapon component grants a bonus die
that can be used whenever the device's Weapon Die is used, including
Defense (Parry) rolls and Dueling rolls.

**Size Limit:** A device with the powered weapon component can be no larger
than Portable size.

**Requires Hand-to-Hand Weapon:** You can only add this component to a
device if it already possesses the hand-to-hand weapon component. The
powered weapon Bonus Die cannot exceed the Weapon Die of the device.

#### Projectile Weapon

A projectile weapon component fires a bullet, dart, arrow, quarrel,
cannonball, or other projectile at a target. Most devices use the
Military (Aim) specialty to attack, and gain a Weapon Die when doing so.
As with other missile weapons in The Queen's Cavaliers, it's not
necessary to track ammunition carried, but it is necessary to know
whether or not the weapon is loaded.

In addition to selecting the Weapon Die, reload time, and range
modifiers for the weapon, the designer also specifies which Weapon
prowess is used with the weapon. Devices which require the Cannon weapon
prowess use the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks instead of
Military (Aim). 

**Magazine:** A projectile weapon can optionally be fitted with a magazine
component to increase the number of times it can be fired without
reloading. In such a situation, the projectile weapon component loses
its reload quality and uses the reload time of the magazine instead.

**Size Limit:** A device with the projectile weapon component can be no
larger than Carriage size. (For cannons on larger buildings or ships,
just place the cannons as separate devices.)

**Ranges:** The range of a projectile weapon component is determined by
adding together a composite of all chosen range lines. Lines cannot be
combined if they both contain a value for the same range. All ranges
must be filled in with a Drop penalty or N/A.

The default ranges for a weapon with no extra space, cost, or power
requirements are: close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 1, long N/A.
