# Tension Trigger

A tension trigger stores energy for use and then releases it. To reset a
tension trigger, you need to take a reset action, which is a combined
action with a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4. Unlike gear trains, tension
triggers store energy for future use rather than immediate use, but
unlike mainsprings a tension trigger will only store that energy for a
single use.
