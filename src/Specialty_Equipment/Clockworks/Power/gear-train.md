# Gear Train

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats :::::::::::::::::::::
A gear train is used to transmit mechanical energy to a device as part
of the same action that uses the device; this mechanical energy is
supplied by the muscular activity of the device's user. This activity is
a combined action that imposes a Drop 4 to Drop 0 penalty on that
action. The power thus supplied is only good for that specific action.

For example, a velocipede might have a Drop 1 penalty required to provide
3 units of power, which can then be used to power the carry and movement
components of the velocipede. This imposes that Drop 1 penalty on
actions undertaken by the rider of the velocipede during the turn in
which it's ridden.

**Variable Gear Train:** The power units and the drop penalty of any given
gear train are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A gear train
(space 0, power supply 2, Drop 2) will always supply 2 power units and
require a Drop 2 penalty to operate. However, a gear train can be made
variable by increasing the space by 1 and the cost by D6 (1 gear); this
allows variable power supply based on the amount of Drop penalty taken
to power it. For example, a variable gear train (space 0+1, power supply
1/2/3, Drop 1/2/4) supplies 1 power unit if a Drop 1 penalty is applied,
2 power units for a Drop 2 penalty, and 3 power units for a Drop 4
penalty.
