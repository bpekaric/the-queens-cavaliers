# Alchemical Capacitor

An alchemical capacitor is a simple jar device that is used to generate,
capture, and store electrical energy through alchemical means. A crude
electromechanical interface allows the energy of the capacitor to be
released and used over an extended period of time.

**Duration:** Each alchemical capacitor functions for 24 hours before needing to be
replaced and reinstalled in a device. The power supply's duration is the
same if it is used once during that time period or used repeatedly.

**Creating an Alchemical Capacitor:** The Magicks (Brew) specialty is
required to create an alchemical capacitor, and it requires the use of
alchemical supplies to do so. The maximum number of alchemical supplies
that can be spent to create an alchemical capacitor is equal to the
brewer's ranks in Magicks (Brew).
