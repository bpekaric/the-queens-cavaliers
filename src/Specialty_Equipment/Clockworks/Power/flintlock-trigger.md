# Blackpowder Flintlock

A blackpowder flintlock is a kind of trigger that fires off once, using
exploding blackpowder to provide energy to power the device's
components. After the blackpowder flintlock is triggered, it must be
reloaded with blackpowder and reset â€“ a procedure which takes an amount
of time as shown on the table below.

Creating a Blackpowder Flintlock: The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create a blackpowder flintlock, and it requires the use of
blackpowder charges to do so. The maximum number of blackpowder charges that can
be spent to create a blackpowder flintlock is equal to the
powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).
