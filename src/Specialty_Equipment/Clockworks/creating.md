# Constructing a Device

**Note: These rules are obsolute and this section needs to be rewritten to 
reflect the current crafting rules.**

There are five steps to creating a device:

1. Plan the Device
2. Purchase the Supplies
3. Build the Parts
4. Install the Parts
5. Complete the Device

## Plan the Device

Before you start, you should plan out what you want your device to do.
Decide how large the device will be – the size of its casing. Determine
what capabilities it will have by the components you choose to install,
and make sure that you have a strong enough power source to provide
power to those components.

Once you have the device planned out, you can spend four hours to make a
Science (Calculus) roll to draft a set of plans for building the device.
This is optional, but is highly recommended as it gives you an
additional die to roll when installing parts in your device and
completing it. 

The difficulty of the Science (Calculus) roll to draw plans is
determined by the complexity of the device you are designing, as shown
on the table below. 

Table: Device Complexity

| Device Complexity | Standard Opposition   |
| :---------------: | :-------------------- |
| 2                 | Easy (3D6)            |
| 3 – 4             | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 5 – 8             | Hard (3D10)           |
| 9+                | Very Difficult (3D12) |

If you earn at least two success points on the Science (Calculus) roll,
you have successfully drawn plans that will give you (or anyone else who
follows them) a D6 bonus on rolls to install and complete the device.
For each additional two success points you spend, you can increase the
size of that die up to a maximum limited by your ranks in Science
(Calculus), as shown below.

Table: Maximum Die

| Calculus Ranks | Maximum Die |
| :------------: | :---------: |
| +1             | D6          |
| +2             | D8          |
| +3             | D10         |
| +4             | D12         |
| +5             | D12         |

**Prototype:** If you have an existing prototype for the device, either
created by yourself or by someone else, you gain a bonus D6 die on the
roll to draw plans. The prototype does not need to be currently
functional for you to gain this bonus.

## Purchase the Supplies

There are three ways to acquire the parts needed for constructing a
device: build them yourself, buy them from another clockworker, or
salvage the parts from another device.

If you are going to build your own parts, you will need to buy gear
supplies. Make a Wealth roll against the cost and availability of gear
supplies – D8 for the cost, and D6 availability unless you are in a
large city (in which case the availability is D0). Each success point on
the Wealth roll enables you to buy one unit of gear supplies since they
are a bulk item.

If you are going to buy certain parts, you will also make a Wealth roll
based on the cost of the part (casing, power source, or component) that
you wish to purchase. The cost for each is listed in the descriptions of
each part later in this chapter. A casing has an availability of D0,
while power sources and components have an availability equal to the
highest die of their costs.

For details on salvaging parts and supplies, see the later section on
Salvage.

## Build the Parts

You can save money by building your own casing, although this does
consume more time. A roll is not necessary, although you must have
competency in the Science (Clockworks) specialty to construct a usable
casing. See the later section on Constructing a Power Source for more
information.

Building a power source or a component requires a number of gear
supplies as shown on the table for that part, and at least four hours'
work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for
each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth
of gear supplies to create components or power sources. Multiple rolls
may be required to create all the parts needed for a complex device.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that you can spend on a single
part is limited to your number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). 

**Standard Opposition:** The difficulty for this roll is Easy (3D6) if you
are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not.

**Tools:**If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** The plans for the overall device do not apply on this roll.

**Prototype:** You gain no bonus for having a prototype of the device when
making this roll.

## Install the Parts

Installing a power source or component in a casing requires a Science
(Clockworks) roll (or series of rolls). The difficulty is Easy (3D6) if
you are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not. Each roll takes
four hours, and each success point installs one power source or
component.

**Tools:** If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** If you have plans for the device, you gain a bonus die based on
the quality of the plans when making this roll.

**Prototype:** If you have a prototype of the device, you gain a bonus D6
die on this roll. The prototype does not need to be currently functional
for you to gain this bonus.

## Complete the Device

Once all the components have been successfully installed, the device
needs to be completed. This requires no roll, but does require one hour
of work per point of complexity of the device.
