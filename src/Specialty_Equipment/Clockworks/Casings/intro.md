# Casings

Casings are measured by their physical size, which determines the amount
of gear space within the casing.

**Purchasing a Casing:** Casings are either purchased at the cost shown
below or constructed by the clockworker for no cost. The availability of
a casing is always D0. Gear supplies cannot be spent on casing costs.

**Creating a Casing:** It takes one hour per point of Gear Space to create a
casing. No skill roll is required, but the clockworker must have at
least one rank in the Clockworks specialty.

**Casing Notation:** A casing is described by listing the size of the casing
followed by the gear space of that casing in parentheses. Examples:
pocket (space 1), person (space 8), building (space 64).

Table: Casings 

| Casing Size | Cost | Gear Space |
| :---------- | :--: | :--------: |
| Pocket      | D0   | 1          |
| Handheld    | D0   | 2          |
| Portable    | D6   | 4          |
| Person      | D6   | 8          |
| Carriage    | D8   | 16         |
| Room        | D10  | 32         |
| Building    | D12  | 64         |

  - **Pocket Size:** A pocket-sized device is easily concealed, requires only one hand to
    operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing.
    Examples include pocketwatches and wrist holsters.

  - **Handheld Size:** A handheld device requires usually requires one hand to operate and can
    be carried on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Examples include clockwork pistols and gearswords.

  - **Portable Size:** A portable device is one which requires two hands to carry and operate,
    or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Most don't need to be
    self-mobile. Examples include clockwork muskets and wing-gliders.

  - **Person Size:** An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue – can't be
    easily carried by a single person without requiring her full attention.
    Most are therefore either stationary devices or self-mobile. Examples include humanoid automata and velocipedes.

  - **Carriage Size:** Larger than a human but smaller than a room, carriage-sized devices are
    on the scale of large pieces of furniture. Unless self-mobile, they
    require several people in order to transport. Examples include clockwork carriages and some industrial machines.

  - **Room Size:** Room-sized devices take up the entire space of a sizable room, and are
    therefore rarely movable unless self-mobile. Examples include some analytical engines and most watermills.

  - **Building Size:** Devices the size of a building are usually as large as a two or three
    story building with a half-dozen rooms. Examples include airships and clock towers.
