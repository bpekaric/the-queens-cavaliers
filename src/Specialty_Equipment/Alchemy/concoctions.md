# Concoctions

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: gamestats :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Concoctions are mixtures that can be prepared beforehand or activated on
the spot by an alchemist orother character with skill in Magicks (Brew).
Making a Brew roll to produce a concoction takes one turn, with Moderate
(3D8) standard opposition; successes are spent as shown on the table
below. Each concoction created requires the expenditure of one unit of Alchemical Supplies.

Concoctions are mixtures of chemicals that can be prepared beforehand by an alchemist
or activated on the spot to produce a chemical effect chosen by the user. Creating a concoction
uses up 1 to 8 sols' worth of chemicals.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  - **Fireflow Glow:** Applying these phosphorescent chemicals to an item will cause it to glow for several hours.
  - **Nauseating Smell:** The terrible stench of these chemicals may drive away anyone with a sense of smell.
  - **Neutralizing Agent:** This cancels the effects of other concoctions.
  - **Oil Slick:** If this liquid lubricant is spread on the ground, it can cause the unwary to slip and fall.
  - **Photoreactive Flash:** The bright light of these chemicals can be seen from several leagues away.
  - **Smoke Cloud:** This thick smoke is impossible to see through and can quickly fill a room.
