# Draughts

Draughts are drinkable liquids that usually come in small bottles or vials.
Each produces a magickal effect on the person drinking it. The effects
usually last an hour or less.

Imbibing a draught is a Drop 1 combined action if the item is in hand;
the effects last until the end of the scene. Draughts with increased
potency have a cost equal to the die value; e.g., a D10 Aggression
Draught has a cost of D10.

Draughts provide a Charm die bonus on a given specialty. Since you can
only include one Charm die in a given dice pool, a character can't
benefit from both the draught and a charmwoven item that affect the same
specialty, only one or the other.
