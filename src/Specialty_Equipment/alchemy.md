## Alchemical Items

Characters with the Magicks (Brew) specialty can produce draughts, salves, and concoctions.

### Draughts

Imbibing a draught is a Drop 1 combined action if the item is in hand;
the effects last until the end of the scene. Draughts with increased
potency have a cost equal to the die value; e.g., a D10 Aggression
Draught has a cost of D10.

Draughts provide a Charm die bonus on a given specialty. Since you can
only include one Charm die in a given dice pool, a character can't
benefit from both the draught and a charmwoven item that affect the same
specialty, only one or the other.

### Concoctions

Concoctions are mixtures that can be prepared beforehand or activated on
the spot by an alchemist orother character with skill in Magicks (Brew).
Making a Brew roll to produce a concoction takes one turn, with Moderate
(3D8) standard opposition; successes are spent as shown on the table
below. Each concoction created requires the expenditure of one unit of Alchemical Supplies.

### Poisons

There are three types of standard poisons in general use: lethal poison,
impairing poison, and sleep poison. For general rules on how to use and
apply poison, see the Medicine (Poison) specialty in the Skills
document.

Poisons are created by expending Alchemical Supplies and making a
Medicine (Poison) roll. New characters who are provocateurs can choose
which poisons they wish to begin with.

Poison antidote is general-use and can be used against any type of
standard poison. It's ineffective against some exotic poisons, such as
yellow-bellied scorpion venom.
