# Summary {.nobreak}

To make your own character for *The Queen's Cavaliers*, follow these instructions
while filling out the character sheet.

## Competency Die, XP, & Yield Limit

As a starting character, you have a D6 competency die and
you start with 0 XP earned, 0 XP spent. Your Yield Limit equals the
maximum value of your Competency Die plus 3, so 9 for a starting
character.

## Choose Two Classes

Your character is a composite of two classes. For each class chosen, record the following information:

### Skills & Specialty Ranks

Your classes determine your starting Skill Competency and your
Specialty ranks. For each skill listed, check the corresponding box to
indicate Competency. For each Specialty listed, place a +1 in the
appropriate blank space; if both classes give ranks in a specialty,
write +2.

### Weapon & Armor Prowess

Your Weapon prowess & Armor prowess are the total of those
granted by your two classes. Check the boxes on the character sheet that
correspond with all of your Weapon and Armor prowesses.

### Social Rank & Wealth

For each of your classes, record the Social
Rank and the die for each rank. For example, if your two classes give
the social ranks Commoner (1D0) and Soldier (1D6), you'd write down
“Commoner (1D0)” and “Soldier (1D6).” Also record the dice values on the
Wealth section of your character sheet, along with your Competency Die.
Your total Wealth Roll consists of those three dice together in a pool.

The social ranks are:

- Commoner (D0)
- Soldier (D6)
- Artisan (D8)
- Noble (D10)
- Royalty (D12)

### Bonus Gear

Each class provides you with a set of clothing and possibly additional equipment.

### Style Maneuvers

Choose one Style Maneuver from each class and record it on your character sheet.

##  Attributes

Your attributes are Verve, Affinity, and Guile. Assign one of
them the value D10, another one D8, and the last D6, and write those in
the appropriate boxes. You probably want to put the D10 in the attribute
that corresponds to the column where you have the most Specialty ranks,
but it's not required.

## Nationality & Languages

Choose and record your nationality.

If you are from Gallinea, you speak and read Gallinean; if not, you
speak your native language automatically and don't know Gallinean
(you'll need to learn it with one of your customizations; see step 10).
For each prowess rank you have in Culture (Scholarship), you speak and
read an additional language. Record each language that you know.

## Passions & Personifications

Choose four Passions for your character that describe what she
feels is important in her life. The standard Passions are Artistry,
Church, Country, Faith, Family, Friends, Justice, Knowledge, Love,
Loyalty, Lust, Pride, and Wealth. You will rank your four chosen
Passions from D12 (the strongest) to D6 (the weakest).

:::::::::::::::::::::::: optional :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Optional:* For each Passion, name one person associated with that passion
and record that person's name to the right of the Passion. This is the
person (living or dead) whom your character most closely associates with
that Passion, either positively or negatively. You can use an existing
NPC (or even PC), or name a new one.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 5. Customizations

You get to choose up to six customizations for your character. Choose
your six customizations from the following list (you can choose each
customization more than once):

- Increase one of your Social Rank values by one step; you can increase each Social Rank die only once.
- Add one Weapon or Armor Prowess.
- Add a new Language.
- Add one Skill Competency.
- Add +1 rank in a Specialty, to a maximum of +2.
- Add a Style Maneuver from either of your classes or from your Nationality.

## 6. Additional Equipment

You begin with bonus gear as determined by your
class listings. You also get your choice of one weapon: Knife, Pistol,
or Sword.

You begin the game with three Rewards – one of them equal to your
Competency Die, and the other two equal to your Social Rank Dice. You
can buy additional equipment by using these Rewards – for example, a D8
Reward can be used to purchase any item of cost D8 or lower.

If you don't want any of your starting gear, you can sell it back and
gain an equivalent Barter Die. For example, if you don't want a musket
(Cost: 1D10), you can trade it in for one D10 Barter Die. You can't make
any Purchase rolls or use your Barter Dice during character creation,
but you can spend your Rewards.

## 7. Character Details

 Write down a name, gender, and other biographical data
for your character. Write down two or three words for your character's
Reputation, such as “Fearsome Opponent,” “Mostly Harmless,” or “Renowned
Lover.” Your reputation need not be true.
