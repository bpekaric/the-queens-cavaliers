# The Lexicographer

With a diverse, multilingual nation, the people of Dragosa are often
themselves amateur linguists. Some of the most respected scholars in
Volstok are found in the Institute of Translation, where they catalogue
words, rephrase idioms, transliterate classic works in other tongues,
and decipher fragmentary texts.

Field researchers from the Institute range far and wide throughout
Elara, Ifran, and beyond -- seeking to capture jkkke in the wild and
bind it into book form, for storage in their guild's libraries.
