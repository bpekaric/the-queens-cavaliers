# The Hanaster

Dragosan merchants do a lot of trade both within and outside of Dragosa,
with many willing to travel quite far in order to earn gold dragas.
Serica, the Coffee Coast, Mwene Karanga, the Storm Islands -- nowhere is
too far to go if a profit can still be turned by the journey. The
highest ranking merchants are part of the Hanaster guilds, and are
effectively nobility within Dragosan cities.

Hanasters are skilled at turning a profit, knowing what is most valuable
at any given location and where it can be acquired for the cheapest.
Most train in the basics of self defense, if just to protect themselves
from thievery.
