# The Theologian

The theologians in Cordera, center of the Asrian faith, all agree on one
thing: the other theologians are wrong. Cloistered in their numerous
seminaries around the holy city, the students, teachers, and scholars
all believe very strongly in their faith, but argue incessantly over the
finest of details, incomprehensible to even well-educated laity.

These arguments often spill over into brawling fights, but as swords and
guns are not allowed on the seminary grounds, the religious scholars
instead conduct ritualized duels with knives hidden within their robes.
Such knife-fights are, by tradition, rarely fatal; most theologians bear
numerous scars on their hands and arms.
