# The Skomorokh

Talania, before the Shattering Frost, had a long tradition of folk dance
in elaborate, colorful costumes. These "skomorokh" were more than just
harlequins, more than mere performers; their parodies and satires served
to represent the common people in the face of oppression by the
bojarynias and tsarinas of the court. By passing themselves off as
simple "clowns" or "jesters," the skomorokhs were able to tell truths
that the ruling families would not want to be spoken openly.

With the fall of Zamorov, the skomorokhs migrated with the rest of the
Talanian populace to warmer climes, settling in Dragosa, Gallinea, and
other lands of the Middle Sea. Unfortunately, the nobility outside of
Talania lack a cultural tradition of tolerating the dancers' antics,
leading to many troubles for skomorokhs outside of their homeland.
