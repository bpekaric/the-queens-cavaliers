# The Mountaineer

Surrounded by mountains on all sides save one, the nation of Varendia
has an understandable affinity for the peaks and valleys of the Lendine
and Tramalvane mountains. Mountaineers are found on both ranges,
engaging in lumbering or the raising of hardy goats. 

Most mountaineers consider themselves to above the fray of the patchwork
states that comprise the Varendian valley, not holding any particular
loyalty to "Flachlanders" and their petty squabbles -- although it's not
uncommon for them to hire themselves out as mercenaries when the heated
politics boil over into warfare.
