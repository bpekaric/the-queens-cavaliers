# The Engineer

Varendia has perfected the art of siegecraft: if your neighboring duchy,
queendom, or grafschaft is being uncooperative and holes up in their
keep, refusing to fight, well, you can just blow the walls down and walk
right in.

Engineers are experts at handling blackpowder and converting into
military use, as well as constructing and repairing other types of siege
engines. They can usually find regular employ in Varendia or beyond,
with such skills being in higher demand during a state of open warfare.
