Unlike Gallinea, its neighbor Albia is a patriarchal society and has
been for centuries. Only a few queens have ruled Albia, fewer than the
number of Kings Regnant in Gallinea.

Located on the Albian peninsula, Albia has had periodic times of
isolationism and expansionism. In past centuries, Albia has controlled
land in both Scanbreille and Albingia in Varendia. The latter has always
been a sticking point, with both nations claiming sovereignty over the
north-facing coast.
