# Locations in Albia

## Dunon, Capital of Albia

The Albian royal family resides in Cadbury Castle in Dunon. Dunon is the
capital of Albia and its main entry from both Gallinea and Varendia. The
surrounding villages extend to the coast of Oceanus. The city is
situated on the bank of the Carlisle River, where it branches into the
Sterling River on one side and continues to the Great Sea on the other.
The Carlisle River makes the trade with Bear Island much more
convenient. Traders often make a dayâ€™s trip from the Island to the
landing at Gawain in Northern Albia. This happens so frequently that
captains often hire a crew for the crossing in one direction and a new
crew for the opposite direction.

## Bear Island

Bear Island boasts some of the best fishers in Albia -- excluding
perhaps the Storm Islands, which aren't considered part of Albia proper.
Bear Islanders also knit a brightly colored and tightly woven fabric
that is treated with sea lion fat to keep out the cold. This fabric is
in much demand in Talania and formerly in Varendia. 

## Storm Islands

The Storm Islands are largely self sufficient and known for their
fishing prowess and use of sea mammal skins for clothing. While the
group of Islands trades among themselves and speak the same language,
each island tends to speak a slightly different dialect and have their
own traditions. One common tradition is *eilean bocadaich*, or island
hopping. Young people, men in particular, often take small craft from
one island to another looking for a marriage partner.
