# The Countries of Elara

Elara is the northern continent that borders the Middle Sea.
Technically it is part of the same continent upon which much of 
Serica is located, but traditional Elaran cartography considers
Elara proper to end just beyond Talania, at the Xhalxan Steppes.

The pre-Qartan people of northwestern Elara -- what is now
Albia and Albingia -- were a light-skinned, light-haired, light-eyed people, 
who came to the mainland from the Storm Islands. Gallinea's
indigenous population had medium-brown skin, dark hair,
dark eyes. Varendia and Talania were occupied by people with
dark hair, ruddy complexions, and dark blue eyes when the Qartan
legions arrived.

The rise of the Qartan Empire and its conquest of Elara resulted
resettlements of both Ifrani and Elaran people, to the extent that
in a post-Qartan world, nearly all of Elara has a mix of Storm
Island, Ifrani, Brigue, and Varen ancestry.
