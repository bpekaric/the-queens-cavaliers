# Scanbria

Many Scanbrians are of Varendish ancestry, and the lands of Scanbria were 
once a separate nation. After several wars with both Varendia and Albia, 
Scanbria was incorporated into Gallinea and has been loyal to the throne 
for several centuries.

The main city in Scanbria is Scanbreille, ruled by Jennevive d'Angelet, 
the Duchess of Scanbria, and her husband Lord Gerhardt from Varendia. 
The peace of the last few years has led to an increase in wealth for the
canbrians, situated along trade routes between Gallinea, Albia, and Varendia. 
Scanbria is also known for its textile industries.
