# The Lowlands

The Lowlands of Gallinea refers to a large region that includes much of central and western Gallinea.

Cities in the Lowlands include:

- Boussole

In addition, anything west of the Luisante River or along its banks, south of Gu√©ve, is considered part of the Lowlands.

The Lowlands are agricultural provinces that farm food for the rest of Gallinea.
