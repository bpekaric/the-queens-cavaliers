# The Jeweled Coast

The seaports along the southern and eastern coast of Gallinea are known as the Jeweled Cities. 
The largest of these is Valerienne; others include Berylle and Rhodope. Arynne Aubene, the 
Duchess of Valerienne, is the sister of Prince-Father Michel.

The cities of the Jeweled Coast are known for their talents with clockworks and other forms of 
technology and scientific artifice.
