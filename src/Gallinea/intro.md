Located in the middle of western Elara, Gallinea considers itself the heart of the world. 
With fertile farmlands throughout the Gallinean valley and abundant natural resources, 
the queendom of Gallinea has become a major power in recent centuries. Gallinea, 
like most of the continent of Elara, was once part of the ancient Qartan Empire.
