# Languages in Gallinea

The primary language of Gallinea is, of course, modern Gallinean. The language is
structurally descended from Old Qartan, but with many native words and names also
based in the indigenous Brigue that predates the Qartan Empire's conquest of the land.

While some Gallineans hold to the arrogance that their tongue is the height of civilization
and thus the only language one need to know, Gallinea's constant interactions with its
neighboring countries means the most practical Gallineans will speak and read at least
one additional languages.

Old Gallinean is French?

While *The Queen's Cavaliers* is written in English, many of the older names for
locations, families, and specific traditions are French. We use French to indicate
an older version of Gallinean than is spoken by modern inhabitants of the queendom.
Contemporary Gallineans can certainly understand the language of several centuries
back, but it sounds old-fashioned and archaic, much as Shakespeare sounds to modern
speakers of English.

**Albian** is primarily spoken in Albia and its colony, New Dunon, as well as the Storm
Islands and the region of Varendia known as Albingia. Many Gallineans learned Albian
during the Twenty Years' War for strategic reasons, and just as many refused to speak
a word of it for patriotic reasons.

**Brigue** is the language of the original inhabitants of Gallinea more than two millennia
back. Despite lending its words to many Gallinean place names, there are no known native 
speakers of Brigue alive today. The language does continue to be used by witches and others
who follow the Old Faith; however, most view phrases in Brigue to be merely "magick
words" with no meaning outside of rituals and superstition.

**Ekalian** is spoken in Gallinea's close neighbor to the east. The ubiquity of Ekalian
sailors in every port has made it the de facto language of sea commerce, and this is
evidenced by the number of Jeweled Coast natives who speak it fluently. Ekalian is also
one of the three languages spoken in Dragosa.

**Gallinean** is also spoken in Elissia, Gallinea's West Ifran colony. Each region of Gallinea 
has its own dialect, and those with an ear for accents and vocabulary can narrow down a Gallinean's
home province quite easily. Scanbrian Gallinean mixes in rough-sounding Varendish language,
while Jeweled-Coast Gallinean has an Ekalian lilt. Lutetians speak Gallinean at a fast
rate, while Lowlanders favor a slow drawl.

**Ifrani** is spoken in the cities of Pitdah and Ubar, as well as throughout the Ifrani
Desert. Although it's not a requirement of the faith, most Devran *Songs of the Desert Mother*
collections are written in the cursive, flowing Aad script. In Gallinea, Ifrani is spoken
primarily within Devran communities.

**Karangan** is the language of The Furthest South, more properly known as Mwene Karanga. 
Few Gallineans even know the name "Mwene Karanga," let alone speak even a word of the language.
Karangan is a rich, complex tongue suitable not only for sociopolitical exchanges but
also highly technical discussions. For the latter reason, a handful of mechanicians are
trying to learn the language.

**Khefikkan** originates in Kheffika, more commonly known in Gallinea as the Coffee Coast.
Khefikkan predates the Qartan Empire and in fact was a precursor to both Old Qartana and the
aboriginal Brigue of Gallinea. Today it's primarily spoken by those who trade extensively with
the lands to the east of Elara.

**Mathain** is the language of the original inhabitants of Bear Island, now part of Albia.
Most Mathain survives in the form of ancient carvings in the Mathac script, a series of slashes
and cuts in stone ruins.

**Old Qartan** was spoken throughout the Qartan Empire and has had the biggest linguistic
impact on Elara and northern Ifran. While few people speak Old Qartan today, it's used ceremonially
in the Asrian religion and *The Books of the Sun* are written in Old Qartan. Thus, every
Asrian Chaplain, and many other lay scholars, can read and write Old Qartan effortlessly.

**Ondalese** is the most direct descendant of Old Qartan; in fact, some speakers of 
Ondalese even refer to it as Modern Qartan. This is a bit misguided, however, as much of
the vocabulary and even sentence structure has changed drastically over the last 1400 years.
Most speakers of Ondalese can't understand Old Qartan at all.

**Serican** is the language of the lands beyond even the Coffee Coast, in the sprawling 
confederation of nation-states known as Serica and Shan. In truth, there are more than a 
dozen other languages spoken in Serica, but speakers from the Sekai region have engaged in
the most trade with Elara, so when a Gallinean thinks of "Serican", she's actually thinking of
Sekai. Serican is an ideographic language whose written form proves difficult for most
Gallineans to master reading or writing.

**Talanian** was formerly spoken primarily in Talania, but with the Shattering Frost and 
resulting Talanian diaspora, the tongue has spread throughout Elara. Talanian is also one
of the three primary languages of Dragosa. In Gallinea, Talanian is most often used in
Valerienne, where many refugees from Talania have settled.

**Varendish** is one of the few unifying factors of the patchwork states known as Varendia.
The common language serves to keep them culturally united even as it also limits their
cultural and technological evolation. The runic script of Varendish is ill-suited for
many modern concepts, so even in Varendia, most scientific and theological writings are
in Gallinean or Albian.
