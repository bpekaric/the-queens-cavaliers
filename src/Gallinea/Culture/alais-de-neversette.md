## Alais de Neversette

In the year 1199 PQ, a previously unknown writer named M.E. Labouret published a novel called "The Laughing Blade" that introduced a new character, Alais de Neversette.

"The Laughing Blade" took Lutetia by storm, and for the last fifty years there have been at least one book in The Various Adventures of Alais Neversette, save for the darkest year of 1244.

Alais lives in the first half of the reign of Queen Delphine -- usually said to be the 1150s to 1160s -- and is the daughter of a minor noblewoman who snuck out from her studies and saved Princess-Regent Clarisse, the young queen's stepmother, from an assassination attempt. This bravery earned her a spot in the Queen's Cavaliers, over the objections of her doting mother and father.

Alais de Neversette is known for three qualities: her reckless abandon, her sexual promiscuity, and her love for wordplay. In the earliest stories she had a pronounced sexist streak -- quite biased against males (even as she romanced them for the cause of the Queen) -- but that aspect has been played down in recent years. She is bisexual and her relationships -- be they with women, men, or others -- legendarily end in heartbreak or death by the end of each novel.

Starting with the second book in 1200 PQ, the titles all began with "Alais de Neversette and ...", and in 1203 the core line of books began being called by the collective title "The Amazing Adventures of Alais de Neversette." Several additional series have appeared, including "The Nautical Adventures of Alais de Neversette," "The Secret Adventures of Alais de Neversette," "The Erotic Adventures of Alais de Neversette," and "The Wartime Adventures of Alais de Neversette." Each series takes a different approach to the character; "Wartime" is about her fictional exploits published during the 20 Years War, for example, while "Erotic" is decidedly not for children.

Highly popular among the common people, Alais is dismissed as dreadfully overwritten prose among those who fancy themselves more educated -- although the enduring popularity of the character and her books have led a minority of scholars to take a greater interest in the books.

The exact identity of M.E. Labouret is unknown, and it's said that even her publishers don't know her true identity. The theories held by Alais scholars is that Labouret is a pen named shared by several people over the years, perhaps a family, as distinctive patterns run through certain books and not others. Most scholars agree that the writer(s) of Alais are natives of Lutetia, and probably from the educated artisan class.

The books are reviled by many of the older members of the Queen's Cavaliers as they present a wholly unrealistic and slightly ridiculous view of life in the Queen's service, but in recent years, many of the new recruits are people who have grown up reading about Alais. Despite the greyswords' opinions, the "Adventures" may be one of the greatest recruiting tools for the Cavaliers and a source of at least some of the public goodwill toward the Queen's Cavaliers.

Several of Alais de Neversette's fictional adventures have been adapted for the stage. Most of these have been performed only in the smaller or common theatres of Gallinea, but a few have had higher profile performances -- although none in front of a royal audience.

"The Laughing Blade" is the story most often adapted for these plays, often titled as "Alais de Neversette and the Laughing Blade." A musical version of "The Nautical Adventures of Alais de Neversette: Alais de Neversette and the Hidden Reef" is one of the largest crowd-pleasers, and has given young Lutetians the idea that all pirates are singing pirates.
