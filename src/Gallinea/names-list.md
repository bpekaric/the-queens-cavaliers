# First Names
A Gallinean first name has a traditional gender association, but in modern times it's 
considered acceptable to choose a name outside of one's traditional gender assignment.

## Surnames

Surnames in Gallinean are usually one of four different types:

  - **Occupational** -- based on one's profession (or the profession of one's family)
  - **Matronymic** -- based on the name of one's mother, or another female ancestor
  - **Geographical** -- based on where one comes from
  - **Descriptive** -- evolved from a nickname, usually based on someone's appearance or an ancestor's appearance

Many geographical or occupational names begin with an article such as *de*, *du*, *des*, *de la*, *d'*, *la*, *le*, and *l'*
Such articles are sometimes dropped, and other times incorporated directly into the name (as with Deveaux).

Some foreigners use non-Gallinean locations with Gallinean articles as surnames, 
such as l'Albien (literally "the Albian") or d'Eccalea ("of Ekalia").

### Examples

  - Deveaux is an occupational name; Martine Deveaux comes from a farming family that at one time was known for selling veal.
  - Aubene is a matronymic name; Arynne Aubene and her brother Prince-Father Michel Aubene are named for their foremother Aubigny.
  - Castenia is a geographical name; Lusienne Castenia's family once used the surname "de Castenia" but have since dropped the article.
  - d'Angelet is a descriptive name. One of Jennevive d'Angelet's ancestors was described as having the
    voice of an angel, and the name was passed on to her heirs.
