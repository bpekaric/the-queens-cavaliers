# History of Lutetia

As far as anyone knows, there has always been a settlement of some kind at what is currently
Lutetia. Ancient carvings in Brigue are still visible in the caves below the Citadel, evidence
of pre-Qartan habitation on the islands of Lac Luisante.

## Qartan Rule

The first Qartan settlement was built approximately 400 years before the fall of the Qartan Empire.
This was a small fort on what is now Ise de Lutetia, on the hill that is now home to Palais de Lutetia.

As the Qartan control over the area grew, they expanded their control by building stone-lined roads that
exist to this day. Rue de la Rivière was the first of these, connecting Lutetia to Valerienne and allowing
rapid movement of the Qartan legions to central Gallinea, solidifying Imperial control over the region.

Later Qartan constructions included walls ringing all four islands -- the remains of which can only be
seen on the southern end of Ile de Lutetia and the older parts of La Roche -- and more roads connecting
Lutetia to Verterre, Scanbria, Sudelune, and Rhodope.

The Temple of the Sun was said to be the most impressive church of Eserre on the continent, a claim
disputed by Ondalan historians but readily believed by the proud Lutetians. The Qartan marketplace
had goods from throughout the Empire, located in the same location as the modern Les Ruelles.

## Fall of Qarta

The end of the Empire came quicker than any expected, and as news arrived from Valerienne, Lutetia 
fell into chaos. Like the rest of the Empire, Gallinea broke apart into smaller countries centered
around the old Qartan marches. 

Riots broke out throughout the city when they realized that outside trade was no longer protected,
that there would be no support from distant Qarta, that the island city was now alone. Lutetians
fled for the countryside as renegade legions moved in to sack the city and carry off its meager
wealth.

## Martialla's Capital

The fires of the burning Temple of the Sun ignited a passion in one young Lutetian priestess who would
later be known as Martialla Conquestus, first queen of Lutetia.

Martialla led a peasant revolt in a successful campaign to oust the squatting ex-legionnaires, 
offering them the choice to pledge their loyalty to her or meet the same fate as Qarta. The ranks
of her army grew with the retaking of Lutetia, and set about to bring the nearby marches into 
fealty as well.

With the heart of Gallinea under her control, Le Conquérante turned her attention to eastern
Gallinea, her forces breaking the Ekalian siege of Rhodope and moving on to take Montambre.
Martialla's realm extended as far as Touriel to the west, Montambre to the north, and Berylle to
the south. Lutetia's neighbors at this time included the Kingdom of Scanbria to the northwest, 
the queendom of Verterre to the west, and the Valerienne empire to the south.

Although she drove the legions from the city and united much of what is now modern Gallinea,
Martialla's greatest desire remained unfulfilled until the reign of her great-granddaughter,
Queen Elian, who rebuilt the Temple of the Sun at its original location. The foundations of
Elian's Temple can still be seen at the Grand Cathedral of the Sun, despite being razed twice
in the centuries since.

## Capital of United Gallinea

Later centuries led to Martialla's heirs ruling all of modern Gallinea save Scanbria, through
warfare, diplomacy, and intermarriage. With control over all of the Gallinean Plain, the
queendom of Lutetia became the queendom of Gallinea. The productive valleys of Gallinea soon
proved to be a tempting target for neighboring nations, and Gallinea faced a number of wars
with Ondala, Ekalia, Ondala again, Varendia, Albia, Ondala a third time, and Varendia again.

These periods of war took a toll on Lutetia, with the capital city being sacked at least
twice with deadly fires buring across all four islands. The experience led Queen Prisca, in the
7th Century, to construct sturdy walls ringing the islands and the even the nearby riverbanks. 

The Priscan Wall still stands today, never having been breached, although Lutetia has long since outgrown the 
original boundaries. Modern Lutetians speak of locations in the city as being "within the wall"
or "outside the wall," although multiple streets, alleys, and bridges reach across the once-impregnable
Mur De Prisca.
