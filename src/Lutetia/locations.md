# Organization

The city of Lutetia and the immediately surrounding countryside are
ruled by the Queen of Gallinea as a royal province, but the day-to-day
adminstration of the city is turned over to the Lady-Mayor of Lutetia.
The Lady-Mayor (or, sometimes, Lord-Mayor) is appointed directly by the
Queen herself and serves at the Queen's pleasure, although it's
traditional for a term as Lady-Mayor to last for five years.

The current Lady-Mayor of Lutetia is Lusienne, countess of Castenia, who
has been in office for three years now. Lady-Mayor Lusienne is skilled
at playing the various nobles, guildmasters, and ambassadors of the
Royal Court off each other, preserving the interests of the Queen while
allowing Her Majesty to remain above much of the petty politicking.

## The Bridges of Lutetia

Lutetia is divided up into 55 different *arrondissements*, or
neighborhoods, named after the 16 bridges that span the Luisante. When a
resident of Lutetia speaks of her location or address within the city,
she talks of arrondissement of that location. Lutetian arrondissements
are mostly wedge-shaped neighborhoods that reach out from the central
islands to the edge of the city.

The 17th Bridge

There are sixteen bridges leading across the lake to the great city of Lutetia. The saying 
goes, "For every person, there is a bridge" - all are welcome in Lutetia, be they nobles, 
commoners, Gallineans or foreigners. By the same token, if one is said to 
be "Seeking the Seventeenth Bridge", that one is someone who has not found their path in life. 
Such outcasts should not be pitied, for it may be that they will find their path - or, 
failing that, forge a new one out of the stone...
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are usually four parts to an arrondissement – the portion on a
central island, the bridge itself, the section on one of the banks of
the Luisante but within the Old Wall, and the corresponding region
outside the Wall. 

These sections are referred to as *sur l'île* ("on the island"), *sur le pont*
("on the bridge"), *travers le pont* ("across the bridge"), and *delà du mur*
(beyond the wall). Thus, a resident could speak of her home as being
in the "8th *arrondissement, delà du mur*", and her school in the "*7th travers le pont"*.

Some exceptions exist. Île Royale, the home of the royal palace, is
always just Île Royale, its own arrondissement. The 1st Bridge spans the
Luisante but not the islands, so the two sides are *rive ouest* (West
Bank) and *rive est* (East bank). Because of the geography of the islands,
there is no *delà du mur* for the 4th, 5th, and 12th Bridges.

Traditionally, addresses are given in Old Gallinean, although it's become
increasingly common among Lutetians to simply use the modern equivalent for
locations. It's understood when one says simply the ordinal name, the
"arrondissement" is silent. For example, "6th *sur le pont*" is a shorter
way of saying "6th *arrondissement, sur le pont* (on the bridge)." 

The following table summarizes Lutetian addresses.

| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |

| *sur le pont*         | *slp* or *pont*     | "On the bridge"                       | Pont de Coeur *sur le pont*  |
| *travers le pont*     | *tlp* or *travers*  | "Across the bridge (inside the wall)" | 15 *tlp*                     |
| *delà du mur*         | *ddm* or *du mur*   | "Beyond the wall"                     | Beyond the South Bridge      |

Lutetian Idioms

Many Lutetian colloquialisms relate to the names of the arrondissements. As they are in
Gallinean but rely on knowledge of the layout of the city, these terms can be 
incomprehensible to outsiders. The Lutetians tend to use these as a shibboleth to
judge others' experience in the city.

  - Someone who is said to be *12 delà du mur* is someone who has escaped from La Roche Prison.
  - *4 delà du mur* is a Lutetian expression meaning "from outside of Lutetia," 
    and is a mildly derogatory for non-Lutetians.
  - Newcomers to Lutetia are often directed to the non-existent *1st Bridge, sur l'île* as a 
    humorous snipe hunt.

# Features of the City

The most notable feature of Lutetia is the Luisante River, which flows
from headwaters in the northern part of Gallinea through the city, where
it forms Luisante Lake. The Luisante then flows south through the
country to Valerienne, where it empties into the Middle Sea.

Luisante means “sparkling” and the river mostly lives up to its name
until it enters the capital, where the extensive underground Lutetian
sewer system meets its waters. The sides of the river are reinforced
with stone walls that form hard channels to control the Luisante until
it spills into the lake to the south of the city.

The four islands at the center of the city are the oldest parts of
Lutetia. The first Qartan settlements were on the largest island, Île de
Lutetia, which was originally surrounded by a wooden, and later stone,
wall. Only a few signs of this original wall remain today, mostly in a
few random sides of old buildings overlooking the river.

The next largest island, Île Royale, is home to the royal palace. The
two smaller islands, Île Citadelle and Île Rocheuse, are named for the
stone castles that dominate each.

The Old Wall was built to surround the islands and the parts of the city
on the east and west banks of the Luisante, but in recent decades
Lutetia has overgrown the boundaries of the wall and expanded out
further into the Gallinean countryside.

Besides the two castles on Île Citadelle and Île Rocheuse, Lutetia is
defended by three stone fortresses ringing the city – La Guette to the
northwest, l'Arsenal to the east, and Le Puissant to the southwest. The
newly constructed Airship Tower at Le Puissant serves an important role
in protecting the city from aerial assault.

Four ancient roads, dating back to the days of the Qartan Empire, meet
in Lutetia on the central Île de Lutetia: Rue de la Rivière, Rue de
Scanbria, Rue du Coeur, and Rue du Sud. Gardens and parks abound in
Lutetia, most notably those along the entire length of the Rue du Coeur
on the central island – which is the scene for many parades and
festivals throughout the year.

The laws of Gallinea are enforced by the city's constabulatory,
operating out of small precinct houses around Lutetia and centered in La
Roche, a converted castle now used as a prison on Île Rocheuse. Those
who break the law are tried in the courts of the Palais de Justice.
