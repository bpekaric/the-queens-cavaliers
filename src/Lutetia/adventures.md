# Important Personages of Lutetia

Lutetia is the center of the world, according to its residents and to some Gallineans. As such, it
attracts a diverse set of visitors from around Elara and Ifran, and even points farther to the east.

Some of the more notable Gallineans are listed here.

## The Royal Court

Members of the Lutetian court include:

**Queen Mariana:** A mere 23 years old, Mariana was never intended to be
Queen; that was meant for her older sister, Crown Princess Jehanne. The
tragic assassination of her mother, Queen Elisse, and Princess Jehanne
catapulted her to the throne unexpectedly. 

**Prince-Consort Carolus:** A princeling from Albia, Carolus was wed to
Princess Mariana at a young age to cement the Treaty of Scanbreille. Now
the consort to the Queen of Gallinea, he often finds himself at odds
with the matriarchal, progressive views of his bride. By tradition, the
Prince-Consort is the honorary head of the Cavaliers.

**Guardian Farrazin:** The head Chaplain of Lutetia, Guardian of the Faith
Farrazin is an ambitious and cunning man. The Corderan-educated cleric
seeks to expand the power of Gallinea throughout the world, and increase
his own personal authority as well. His own Holy Guardsmen are in an
ongoing rivalry with the Queen's Cavaliers. In addition, he also serves as
the Minister of Justice.

**Prince-Father Michel Aubene:** Younger brother of the Duchess of
Valerienne, Michel was the husband and consort of Queen until her
untimely death. He served for a year as prince-regent before Queen
Mariana ascended the throne on her 18th birthday, and he often finds
himself disagreeing with Prince-Consort Carolus, his Albian son-in-law.

**Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford:** The Duke of Bedyngford is the current
ambassador to Gallinea from Albia. He delights in the fashions and
pageantry of the Lutetian court, and is a frequent drinking partner of
his younger countryman, Prince Carolus.

## Artisans

Most of the artisans in Lutetia are members of guilds which both represent
their interests and control how they do business. Some of the more powerful
guilds include the Mechanicians' Guild, the Charmweavers' Guild, the 
Alchemists' Guild, the Dockworkers Union, and the Winemakers Guild.

## Organized Crime

While Lutetia seems to be rather crime-free, the truth is that criminals in
the city have learned to keep their heads down and work within the system.

A few notorious art thieves work the city, with one of the most famous being
the Shadow Cat. Smugglers regularly bring goods in and out of Lutetia, usually
with the tacit or direct involvement of the region's River Guard who are known
to be easier to bribe than the Lutetian city watch or the Holy Guardsmen.

As the nobility are a law unto themselves, they can get away with things that
most Gallineans would never be able to pull off. A few called-in favors and
bribes are enough to get most charges dismissed, and most nobles are skilled at
crafting plausible deniability as well. Many a hireling sits in La Roche
prison, having taken the fall for their noble patron with promises of increased
reward upon their release from incarceration.

Finally, there is the mysterious crimelord known as The Queen of Rats. Many in
Lutetia, especially the constabulatory, believe her to be an urban legend. 
However, those who live on the streets swear that not only is she very real, but 
can hear anything that is heard by Lutetia's many rats, anywhere in the city.
For this reason, the common folk believe it is bad luck to kill a wild rat,
and many will seek to simply catch and release the rodents if discovered, rather
than kill them with traps.

# Lutetian Adventures

Adventures in and around Lutetia can take several forms. With every social rank
in Gallinea represented, it's easy to craft an adventure that can encompass any
type of character.  Some of the more common adventure types include:

**Crime-Solving Adventure:** The players are recruited to solve a mystery
by gathering clues, following conclusions, and having a showdown with the 
perpetrators. Opponents can include crime bosses, low-ranking criminals,
shopkeepers who are unwilling to talk, nobles who resent the players' intrusion
into their business, and constables who feel put on the spot. This adventure type
is a good fit for characters or players who are authority figures such as
cavaliers or constables, but any group could be pressed into service if they
need to clear their names.

**Intrigue Adventure:** An intrigue adventure is similar to a crime-solving
adventure, although there is less emphasis on solving a mystery and more on
gaining an upper hand over one's opponents. This is a good storyline to involve
players who are nobles or chaplains, especially as arch-chaplain Farrazin has
any number of schemes going at any time. Expect to use the Deceive and
Etiquette specialties as much, or more than, any Dueling or Defense specialites
are used.

**Heist Adventure:** This is the reverse of a crime-solving adventure, as the
players are committing a crime instead of solving one! A heist adventure needs
a simple goal, an overly complex plan, a group of experts, and some hidden twists.
This is good for players who are fans of heist movies, as well characters such
as visionaries or virtuosas who thrive on putting on a show. More law-abiding
characters can still participate in heist adventures if the target of the heist
is a corrupt noble or merchant prince who they seek to expose.

**Diplomacy Adventure:** As the capital of Gallinea, Lutetia is home to visitors
and delegations from around Elara and Ifran, and sometimes even further away.
You can play up the culture shock as cavalier player characters are called upon
to escort a visiting dignitary around the city. Complications can include rival
ambassadors such as Lord Bedyngford trying to show up the Gallineans, unannounced
side trips to lower-class neighborhoods, or even a xenophobic mob who object to
the foreign influence that's creeping into Lutetia.

**Revenge Adventure:** In this type of adventure, someone is out for revenge.
Usually, it's a past villain trying to get back at the cavaliers for foiling
one of her prior plots, but sometimes it could be a relative of a player
character or even someone who hires the player characters to avenge a wrong.
This is the most likely kind of scenario to feature direct combat, and the
opponents usually have a group of henchpeople to run interference for them.
 
**Slice-of-Life Adventure:** This adventure type is less concerned with plots and
more with personalities. The archetypal slice-of-life adventure follows the
cavaliers through an average day or week, with complications being thrown in along
the way that they have to overcome. One of the best ways to handle this is by using
the optional rules on Passions to randomly determine which player characters'
passions are tested, and possibly even have an appearance by one or more of the
characters' personifications of said passions.
