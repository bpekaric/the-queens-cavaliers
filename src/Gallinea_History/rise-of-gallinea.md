# Rise of the Gallinean Nation

In a time of oppressive ex-Legions, feudal warlords, and warring kings, a land in turmoil 
cried out for a heroine, and one answered. She was Martialla, a former priestess forged in the heat of 
Lutetia's burning Temple.

Known in modertn times by her Qartan title of Martialla Conquestus or her Old Gallinean name as Martielle 
le Conquérante, she led a revolt that forced the ex-Legionnaires to join her growing army or face execution.
She would later use this strategy on the Valerian Empire and the queendom of Verterre, although Scanbria
was not to come under Gallinean rule until centuries later.

Proclaiming herself the first Queen of Galinia, Martialla consolidated her power over most what is now
modern Gallinea, with Persolei and Montabre finally falling to Martialla's granddaughter in the next
century. Martialla's legacy continues to today, with many young women being given the Conquérante's
name or a variant thereof, such as Martielle, Maralla, Martine, or Marianna.
