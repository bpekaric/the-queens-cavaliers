# Fall of the Qartan Empire

After a long period of encroaching desert and political infighting, the Qartan Empire met
its end. Some say it was because the god Ashra turned her eye away from Qarta, plunging it
into darkness. Others claim that a revolt by the Legions led to the fracturing of the 
Empire. Another theory holds that a magickal attack with alchemical bombs left Qarta an
uninhabitable wasteland, and without its center, the Empire could not hold together.

The latter theory, while not commonly held by most historians, does account for the current
state of the city of Qarta. Once the capital of the world, Qarta is now an empty ruin. 
Nothing grows or lives within 10 leagues of the city, and those who stay longer than a few
days find themselves growing sickly and weak.

What is known is this: On **15 Germinal**, in what is now the year 1 Post Qarta, 
ships and caravans arriving at the city found it
empty. Not a single woman or man to be found. No oxen plowed the fields, no cats prowled
its famous garden terraces, not a single ant crawled across the stone.

Most accept that there were no corpses, human or otherwise, found within Qarta, although
one theory states the bodies were carted off in the next year as former subjects of the
Empire sacked the capital on short-lived raids that took the wealth of Qarta's great coffers.

With the capital effectively gone, the Qartan Empire lacked its Matriarch, its Primores Senatus,
and many of its Legions. The conquered parts of the Empire soon fell into bloody revolution,
with the occupying Legions either grabbing power for themselves or supporting the local
leadership.

**Lutetia** was occupied by the Qartan Legions, who set up military rule over what is now 
Coeur de Gallinea. In the south of Gallinea, a Legion Legate declared herself empress of the
**Valerian Empire,** one of several such states to proclaim itself the heir of Qarta.

The northern Qartan March of **Scanbria** established a kingdom and conquered surrounding
regions. To this day, the Duchesses and Dukes of Scanbreille claim direct descent from these
northern warlords.

Western Gallinea, a land of farmers who produced the Empire's food supplies, turned upon
the Legions and drove them from **Verterre,** setting up a queendom in that port city.

Similar patterns happened throughout the former Qartan Empire. **Varendia**
fell into a chaotic patchwork of shifting state borders that continues to this day. The
three Qartan provinces of the **Dragon Coast** made war upon each other until, centuries later,
they joined together as the modern nation of Dragosa.

**Ondala** had been the home of the largest Asrian church outside of Qarta, and its rolling
hillsides held many villas belonging to Qartan nobility. As such, the Ondalans considered
thesmelves the true inheritors of Qartan rule, leading them to centuries of conflict with
their neighbors who did not wish to "rejoin the Empire."

The natives of **Albia** struck from Bear Island against the crumbling Imperial infrastructure, 
earning both freedom and a penchant for bloody slaughter. The people of **Ekalia** simply went on 
with their business as they had before the Qartan Empire, electing their own rulers,
following their own gods, and plying the Middle Sea in their own ships.

Distant **Talania** fell under ex-Legion rule, with today's Talanian nobles being directly
descended from Qartan officers who siezed power and land. On the continent of Ifran,
the cities of **Pitdah** and **Ubar** once again enjoyed freedom from their imperial neighbor
and rival, and both began to prosper with the Empire's decline.
