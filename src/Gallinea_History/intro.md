# History of Gallinea {.breakbefore}


Gallinea is a proud nation with a long history going back over two thousand years. Originally
occupied by a people known as the *Brigue*, the lush farmlands and towering mountains of
Gallinea later were conquered and colonized by the Qartan Empire. When that empire fell, as
all do, the following centuries saw the former Qartan marches coming together to create a
Gallinean queendom.

The history of Gallinea is marked by a tradition of warfare, both with its neighbors and in
civil wars where Gallinean fought Gallinean. Prior to the start of the Twenty Years' War with
Albia, the queendom had only a few years of peace since the previous war.
