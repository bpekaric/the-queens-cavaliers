# Pre-Qartan Gallinea

When the Qartans came to Gallinea, it was already occupied by a thriving civilization. 
More sophisticated in matters of medicine and magicks than their Mathac neighbors, in
what is now Albia, the Gallineans were mostly peaceful, engaging only in small skirmishes
with competing villages over resources. Thus they were unprepared for the arrival of the
Qartan legions.

Most modern Gallineans are aware that there was *something* in Gallinea before the 
Qartans, but few realize the extend to which the Brigue culture continues to survive
on in the traditions, folklore, and magicks of Gallinea.

Brigue magicks were based around reading omens, primarily through the use of scattered
leaves, stones, or other natural materials.  This tradition lives on today, even if
the practioners of Portents-reading may be unaware of the roots of their magicks.

Gallinean medicine is based, in part, on the training and experience of centuries of
Brigue midwives and wise women, who continue to help rural provincials as "witches."

The Brigue language is no longer spoken and only a few examples are known to exist,
but it does appear in the form of "arcane" carvings and "magick words" that are simply
ordinary glyphs and phrases whose plain meaning has been lost.
