# The Assassination of Queen Elisse

:# Whodunnit?

You'll notice we don't actually tell you who killed Queen Elisse. That's
deliberate -- it leaves the decision up to each MJ to decide who the
real killers are in her campaign of *The Queen's Cavaliers*. She can even
decide to not answer the question and leave it open-ended.
