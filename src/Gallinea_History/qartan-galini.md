# Qartan Galini

**Qarta**, located on the western corner of the continent of Ifran, was city of 
middling importance until the 6th century PQ. Eclipsed by the wealth of its
older neighbors to the east, including Pitdah, Ubar, Bareket, and Aad, Qarta
excelled in stonework and construction.

Like most in northern Ifran, the Qartans worshiped a pantheon of gods similar
to that found in modern day Ekalia. Of these, the sun goddess **Ashra** was the
matron deity of Qarta, as Devra was the matron deity of Aad, Khedit of Pitdah,
and so on.

Over the years, the Qartans came to believe that Ashra was the supreme god over
all other gods, and later that she was the only true god. Around 600 PQ, the
corrupt ruling family of the Qartan queendom was overthrown by a general who
would be known as **Ashere-Mantur** -- Ashra incarnate, the first of the goddess-empresses of Qarta. She declared the creation
of the **Qartan Empire** and with her legions, began the centuries-long process of
taking over the known world.

Although they had explored and mapped Elara much earlier, the Qartan conquest
of Gallinea didn't begin in earnest until the **3rd century PQ.** The region known
today as the Jeweled Coast was the first be conquered, and the Qartan viasmiths
started building what would be the first of the Great Roads of Gallinea, the
Sea Road. The Lowlands fell under Qartan control next, then central Gallinea
and finally the north of Scanbria. From there, the Qartans moved on into Albia,
Albingia, and Varendia.

Gallinea was divided into six roughly equal regions known as "marches," each
ruled over by a governor appointed from Qarta who served at the pleasure of the goddess-empress.
These were **Solis** in the southwest, **Valira** in the south, **Rhoseus** in the east,
**Scanbri** to the north, **Viridiri** to the west, and **Galini** in the center.
