# The Moon-Curser

Contrary to popular Gallinean belief, not all inhabitants of the West Ifran 
colony of Elissia are banished criminals ... just most of them. Some are actually 
daughters and sons of criminals rather than exiles themselves!

Despite that fallacy about their origins, it remains true that Elissians are known 
for their lack of respect for the law. Many of these become Moon-Cursers -- 
smugglers who bring contraband in and out of the colonies by dark of night. 
While most travel by sea, dodging the fleets of Gallinea, Ondala, and Albia, 
a few take overland routes into or out of Elissia. Their name derives from the 
fact that a full moon is a smuggler's worst when trying to remaining hidden from the authorities.
