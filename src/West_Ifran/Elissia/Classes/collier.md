# The Collier

The western coast of Ifran was long thought to be a dismal, sweaty, swamp-infested strip of 
land devoid of any economic or military value, good only for dumping undesirables who were 
no longer welcome in Gallinea but who weren't quite wicked enough to execute.

At least, that was true until the discovery of phlogistone, a relative of blackpowder that, 
when burned, produces fumes with extreme buoyancy properties. While all nations of Elara contain 
scattered deposits of phlogistone, large quantities of the substance were found in the foothills 
all along West Ifran.

This has led to a large influx of prospectors, miners, traders, and others, flocking to Elissia in 
hopes of making it rich. Most return penniless after a few months in the humid hills, but some 
manage to cope with the sweltering heat and become professional Colliers. It may be dangerous work, 
but unlike most professions in Elissia, it does pay well.
