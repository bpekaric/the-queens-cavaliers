The main city in Scanbria is Scanbreille, ruled by Jennevive d'Angelet, 
the Duchess of Scanbria, and her husband Lord Gerhardt from Varendia. 
The peace of the last few years has led to an increase in wealth for the
canbrians, situated along trade routes between Gallinea, Albia, and Varendia. 
Scanbria, at 150,000 residents the third-largest city in Gallinea, is also known for its textile industries.

Aff√ªtaine is the only other major city in Scanbria, and trades regularly with
Gallinea's neighbor to the northwest, Albia.
