Located in the middle of western Elara, Gallinea considers itself the
heart of the world. With fertile farmlands throughout the Gallinean
valley and abundant natural resources, the queendom of Gallinea has
become a major power in recent centuries. Gallinea, like most of the
continent of Elara, was once part of the ancient Qartan Empire.

All told, there are 46 different provinces in Gallinea, including
Lutetia, Valerienne, Berylle, Rhodope, and Scanbria. Each is controlled
by a countess, baroness, or duchess (or, rarely, a count, baron, or
duke) and all pledge loyalty to the Queen.

Apart from the major cities, the rest of the provinces are rural farming
fiefdoms, and many from Lutetia tend to look down upon their less
sophisticated, less cosmopolitan countrymen.

## Lutetia

The capital of Gallinea, Lutetia is built upon a lake island and
surrounded by 16 huge bridges that reach out to the farmlands and
estates that circle the city.

Lutetia is known for its majestic architecture as well as its green
parks. Landmarks include the Royal Palace, the Universities of Lutetia,
the Grand Cathedral, and the Gallinean Library.

Members of the Lutetian court include:

**Queen Mariana:** A mere 23 years old, Mariana was never intended to be
Queen; that was meant for her older sister, Crown Princess Jehanne. The
tragic assassination of her mother, Queen Elisse, and Princess Jehanne
catapulted her to the throne unexpectedly. The Queen's champions are
traditionally known as the Queen's Cavaliers.

**Prince-Consort Carolus:** A princeling from Albia, Carolus was wed to
Princess Mariana at a young age to cement the Treaty of Scanbreille. Now
the consort to the Queen of Gallinea, he often finds himself at odds
with the matriarchal, progressive views of his bride. By tradition, the
Prince-Consort is the honorary head of the Cavaliers.

**Guardian Farrazin:** The head Chaplain of Lutetia, Guardian of the Faith
Farrazin is an ambitious and cunning man. The Corderan-educated cleric
seeks to expand the power of Gallinea throughout the world, and increase
his own personal authority as well. His own Holy Guardsmen are in an
ongoing rivalry with the Queen's Cavaliers.

**Prince-Father Michel Aubene:** Younger brother of the Duchess of
Valerienne, Michel was the husband and consort of Queen until her
untimely death. He served for a year as prince-regent before Queen
Mariana ascended the throne on her 18th birthday, and he often finds
himself disagreeing with Prince-Consort Carolus, his Albian son-in-law.

**Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford:** The Duke of Bedyngford is the current
ambassador to Gallinea from Albia. He delights in the fashions and
pageantry of the Lutetian court, and is a frequent drinking partner of
his younger countryman, Prince Carolus.

**Lady-Mayor Lusienne Castenia:** The countess of Castenia is the current
lady-mayor of Lutetia, and is renowned as much for her lavish formal
parties as her political scheming.
