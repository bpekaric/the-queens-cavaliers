Located in the middle of western Elara, **Gallinea** considers itself the
heart of the world. With fertile farmlands throughout the Gallinean
valley and abundant natural resources, the queendom of Gallinea has
become a major power in recent centuries. Gallinea, like most of the
continent of Elara, was once part of the ancient Qartan Empire.

All told, there are 46 different provinces in Gallinea, including
Lutetia, Valerienne, Berylle, Rhodope, and Scanbria. Each is controlled
by a countess, baroness, or duchess (or, rarely, a count, baron, or
duke) and all pledge loyalty to the Queen.

Gallinea is divided into four main regions: **Scanbria,** in the north;
**Coeur de Gallinea** in the center of the country; **the Jeweled Coast,** on
Gallinea's south and east coasts on the Middle Sea; and the agricultural **Lowlands,**
in western and southern Gallinea.

Apart from the major cities, the rest of the provinces are rural farming
fiefdoms, and many from Lutetia tend to look down upon their less
sophisticated, less cosmopolitan countrymen.

## Lutetia

The capital of Gallinea, **Lutetia** is built upon a lake island and
surrounded by 16 huge bridges that reach out to the farmlands and
estates that circle the city.

Lutetia is known for its majestic architecture as well as its green
parks. Landmarks include the Royal Palace, the Universities of Lutetia,
the Grand Cathedral, and the Gallinean Library.
