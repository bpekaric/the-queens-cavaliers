:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The major cities on the Jeweled Coast include Berylle, Canard-Noir, Montambre, Persolei, Rhodope, and Valerienne

The **Rue de la Mar** connects all of the Jeweled Cities together, although there is also frequent traffic by sea between the cities as well.

## Berylle

The closest of the Jeweled Cities to Lutetia, **Berylle** is located in the middle of the Jeweled Coast near the site of an old
Qartan mining town and natural spring. Rue de Berylle connects the seaport of 100,000 with the capital, and is the only major roadway
in Gallinea built after the fall of the Qartan Empire.

## Canard-Noir

The unfortunately named **Canard-Noir** is the smallest of the large cities on the Jeweled Coast, with a permanent population of
only 50,000. Located on the banks of the Canard river, Canard-Noir is known for its blacksmithing and metalworking.
The young comtesse Josette de Canard-Noir makes no secret of her desire to expand her city's influence, nor her
disdain for the rest of the Jeweled Cities.

## Montambre

**Montambre** is the northernmost of the Jeweled Cities, and accordingly trades extensively with Varendia as well as Ekalia to the
east. Most of the population of 90,000 work in the mines and smelteries of Montambre, creating weapons that are of high quality
and even higher demand.


## Persolei

It's said that **Persolei** is the farthest you can go in Gallinea and still be in Gallinea. While that's technically accurate in only about
half the provinces of Gallinea, it's true that Persolei is located far to the southwest of the country. The people of Persolei are
almost as much Ondalan as they are Gallinean; on a clear day, they can see across the channel to Puerto Salida. With architecture heavily
influenced by Diegan styles and a populace of 85,000, most of whom are bilingual, Marquis Gaspar de Persolei hopes to keep Lutetia on
good terms with Queen Ximena to the south, as Persolei was repeatedly razed during the last war with Ondala. And the war before that. And
the war before *that* ...

## Rhodope

**Rhodope** is a seaport of 125,000 people located on the easternmost coast of Gallinea. Their
major export is clockwork machinery, and they trade extensively with their Ekalian neighbors.
Along with Persolei, Rhodope is notable for having a male duchess, known as a "duke," a man
named Baudouin de Longpre. It's said that Baudoin would love to step down in favor of his
daughter, Genevieve, but the younger de Longpre impulsively spends her time fooling around
with the Queen's Cavaliers ... and fooling around with any pretty face that catches her eye.

## Valerienne

**Valerienne** is the second-largest city in Gallinea and called the "Jewel of Gallinea" -- 
primarily by its residents and never by the people of Lutetia.  The current Duchess is 
Arynne Aubene, older sister of Prince-Father Michel.

As Lutetia is known for its bridges, so is Valerienne known for its canals. 
Fully 75% of the city is located on islands in the delta region of the Luisante River, 
and small canal boats are used to navigate through Valerienne in lieu of paved roads. 
Walkways line the canals as well, although those are usually only wide enough to accommodate hand carts.

Due to its location on the Jeweled Coast and the Luisante, Valerienne is a center of trade 
going in and out of Gallinea to the Middle Sea, to Ondala, and to the colony of Elissia. 
As a result, Valerienne is a wealthy and cosmopolitan town of 200,000 people where multiple 
languages can be heard among the piers and quays of the expansive district known as the Docks.

Valerienne is home to the largest number of Talanian refugees outside of Dragosa. 
These expatriates have settled in a district bordering the Docks which has been named New Zamorov, 
similar to other ethnic enclaves of the same name found in other major cities. Tensions have 
been rising lately between the Talanian immigrants and the older residents of Valerienne, due to a
perception of increased crime.
