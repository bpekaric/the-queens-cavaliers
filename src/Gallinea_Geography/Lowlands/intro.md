The Lowlands of Gallinea refers to a large region that includes much of central and western Gallinea.
In addition, anything west of the Luisante River or along its banks, south of Gu√©ve, is considered part of the Lowlands.
The Lowlands are agricultural provinces that farm food for the rest of Gallinea.
