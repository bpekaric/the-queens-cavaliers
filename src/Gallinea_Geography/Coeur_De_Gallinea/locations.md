# Locations in Coeur de Gallinea

The **Rue de Coeur**, an old stone-paved Qartan via, runs through Coeur de Gallinea, which contains the cities of Castenia, Guéve, Lutetia and Touriel. In addition,
there are numerous small towns and farming hamlets throughout the region.

The Lente river joins the Luisante in Coeur de Gallinea.

## Castenia

**Castenia** is the nearest province to Lutetia, entirely surrounding the 
capital, and bordering provinces such as Scanbreille, Guéve, and
Touriel.

Just west of the city lies **Château de Galinia,** which at one point in history
marked the northern extent of the country under Queen Martialla I, the first
monarch of Gallinea.

In addition to being geographically adjacent to Lutetia, the province has strong
political ties with the Crown. The Comtesse de Castenia, **Lusienne Castenia,** was appointed
the Lady-Mayor of Lutetia by Queen Elisse, the current queen's predecessor, and
she is among the most loyal supporters of Queen Mariana.

The green hills of Castenia are rarely used for farming these days, as stately manors of
the wealthiest Gallineans are plentiful in the province. The only crop regularly grown in Castenia
is wine, and nearly every manor has an attached winery. Each noble is certain that their
own vintage is superior, of course.

## Guéve

East of Castenia lies **Guéve**, where the sluggish Lente river joins the Luisante.
Guéve is a major river port and is located on the Rue de Berylle, making it one of
the primary gateways for goods going in and out of Lutetia.

As a center for trade, Guéve has a very strong merchant class that considers the
seat of the county to be the Second City of Coeur de Gallinea, even though both
Touriel and Castenia have larger populations.

House Degueve has held Guéve for centuries; the last Comte de Guéve, **Léandre Degueve,**
passed away two years ago and  upon his death his wife, **Dyann,** assumed his title.

Dyann is also the younger sister of the late Queen Elisse and is thus the aunt of
the current queen, Mariana, making Dyann a princess in her own right. Princess Dyann's oldest
daughter **Amarante is**, until the queen and king have children, the Princess-Royal of
Gallinea and the heir apparent to the throne if something should happen to Queen Mariana.

## Touriel

The province to the west of Lutetia is **Touriel**, where the Rue du Coeur and Rue de Bois
meet. In contrast to the wealthier provinces of Couer de Gallinea, Touriel is a city of
wagoners, cartwrights, and wheelsmiths. The guilds employ private mercenaries to guard the
two Grandes Rues, supplementing the Queen's Army and the local militias. Recent bandit
attacks along the forested Rue des Bois have all stake-holders concerned.
