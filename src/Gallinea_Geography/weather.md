# Weather {.breakbefore}

Gallinea is a temperate country. Lutetia, located inland in the middle of the
country, enjoys warm winters and cool summers, with moderate amounts of rainfall
and rare snow in winter. Scanbria is consistently cooler than Lutetia, while
the Jeweled Coast tends to be warmer. The west coast of Gallinea, from 
Affûtaine to Persolei, is often hit by cold storms from the northwest that
sweep in over Albia, originating in the Storm Islands.

To randomly determine the weather on any particular day in Gallinea, look up the
nearest major city on the following table. Then roll for both the temperature and
the precipitation, and look them up on the next two tables.

Gallineans measure temperature in terms of *décigrees* -- each of which
is equal to one tenth of the span between the freezing point and the boiling
point of water. 

Compare the temperature roll to the table below to determine the high
temperature for any given day. The low temperature will be 1 décigree
less than the high, except in winter when it's only half a décigree lower.

Table: Temperatures in Gallinea

| Die Roll | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter |
| :------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| 1        | -0.5   | 1.5    | 0.0    | -1.5   |
| 2        | 0.0    | 1.5    | 0.0    | -1.0   |

| 14       | 3.0    | 4.0    | 3.0    | 2.0    |

Use the following table by crossreferencing the precipitation roll with 
the season. If the temperature is 0 décigrees or lower, the rain will
fall as snow instead.

:# Temperature Scales

What do Gallinean décigrees equate to? Converting from décigrees to
Celsius is trivial; simply multiply by ten. The table below shows the
equivalent temperature for each décigree.

| Décigrees | Celsius | Fahrenheit | Description    |
| :-------: | ------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| -1        | -10 C   | 14 F       | Below freezing | 
| 0         | 0 C     | 32 F       | Freezing       |
| 1         | 10 C    | 50 F       | Cool           |
| 2         | 20 C    | 68 F       | Comfortable    |
| 3         | 30 C    | 86 F       | Hot            |
| 4         | 40 C    | 104 F      | Very hot       |

The descriptions are how the typical Gallinean would view each temperature,
and as most commoners don't have thermometers, how they speak of the day's
weather in casual conversation.
