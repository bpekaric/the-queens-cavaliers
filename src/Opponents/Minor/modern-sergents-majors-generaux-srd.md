##### Modern Sergents-Majors Généraux

*Minor Character*

She is the very model of a sergeant-major general: she has
information on vegetables, animals and minerals. She knows the kings of
England and can quote historical battles. She's well acquainted, too, with
mathematical matters. 

Her practical experience on the battlefield, however, may be very
limited.

She can make a great foil for cavaliers in a city-based adventure, or
could be leading any military unit in the field.
