# Creating Major Characters   # {.breakbefore}

As key opponents in a game of *The Queen's Cavaliers*, major characters
should be created to serve specific roles in your game, such as a master
villain, a major foil, a powerful ally, or a respected mentor. The
recommended method is to build a major opponent in the same way that
you'd create a player character, choosing two classes and so on, and
then adding extra experience.

But sometimes you don't have the time to do it that way, and you just
need to create one simply. Here's how that works.

  - First, come up with an idea of what this character is like, and what
    kind of role she'll play in the campaign.
  - Pick five specialties which she'll use the most; perhaps Lunge for a
    duelist or Inspire for a chaplain. These are her primary
    specialties.
  - Choose another five specialties which are important, but not the
    focus of her activity. These are secondary specialties.
  - Finally, pick another five tertiary specialties, which are things
    she can do, but aren't central to her character.
  - Assign a D10, D8, and D6 to her attributes in a way that makes sense
    to you, based on her concept.
  - Choose how much of a challenge you want to present to your
    cavaliers; this will determine approximately how many experience
    points she'll have. Generally speaking, you'll want a major opponent
    to have about as many experience points as the sum of all your
    cavaliers, with a minimum of around 20 XP and a maximum around 200.
  - Consult the table, Opponent Creation, and choose one line
    representing how many experience points your major character will
    have.
  - She will have the listed number of ranks in each of her primary,
    secondary, and tertiary specialties, as well as competency in the
    associated skills -- plus Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and
    Interaction.
  - Assign prowess in two to four types of weapons, zero to two types of
    armor, and two to four languages, based on your concept.
  - Pick her social class rank, assign one or more outfits, and equip
    her with whatever weapons, armor, and other equipment makes the most
    sense.
  - Most major characters will have two to four pieces of charmwoven
    apparel, with a charm die equal to their competency die. These charm
    dice usually assigned to one of the primary specialties or one of
    the tertiary ones.
  - Choose four Passions, assigning them in order from D12 to D6.
  - Pick three Style Maneuvers.
  - Finally, if she has any additional XP as shown on the table, spend
    those on whatever else you think might be fun. Extra style maneuvers
    or specialty ranks in Initiative are always good choices\!
