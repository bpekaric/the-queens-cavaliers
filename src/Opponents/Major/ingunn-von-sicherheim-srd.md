This foreign noblewoman, is a patriot first and foremost -- at least
when her pride doesn't get in the way. Ambitious and thoughtful,
she is a planner who involves herselves in a wide variety of schemes
and plots. While most are practical nature, some are more personal
and are aimed at avenging a perceived or actual sleight. 

She will particularly try to humble any player character who dares to show
her up in public, be that by turning down an offer employment, thwarting
her plans, or simply knowing or achieving more than her.
