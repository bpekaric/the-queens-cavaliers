## Opponent Groups ## {.breakbefore}

Certain types of opponents are usually encountered in mixed groups. Here
are several that you can use or adapt when you need them.

In the listings that follow, *P* means one of these for every player
character in your group, and *P*/2 means one for every two player
characters. Listed Ideals can be used once each per group, in addition
to the Passions of each member; remember that Passions and Ideals can
reflect either an inclination toward a value or against one.

For more information using on scope, attributes, and assets, see the
section on Organizations.
