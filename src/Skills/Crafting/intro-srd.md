## Crafting

As described in Chapter 4, "Skills & Specialties," characters
can use most specialties in order to craft items
related to that specialty. The requirements for crafting are:

  - **You need to spend time.** The time varies -- minutes, hours, days,
    weeks. You can't craft more than 8 hours in a day. (Lutetia's unions
    are quite strong.) You may be able to increase or decrease the time
    to craft an item, to affect your success at crafting.
  - **You need tools to work.** If you don't have the right tools, you
    at least need something that can function as the right tools, even
    if you don't get an Item Die from the makeshift tool.
  - **You need at least one specialty rank.** You can't make a crafting
    roll based on the skill alone. Each further specialty rank adds new
    items you can craft.
  - **You need to expend supplies.** Supplies are counted in "units", an
    abstracted measure of the raw material you have on hand. In most
    cases, you can't substitute something else, but check with your MJ.
  - **You need to make a specialty roll.** If you've met all the other
    requirements listed above, you automatically succeed on the roll and
    craft something. The purpose of the roll is to determine how well of
    a job you did on the crafting. The more success points you spend,
    the better the final product. You can't gain style points on
    crafting rolls.
