### Rushing

You don't always have the luxury of time when crafting. Perhaps there's
only 30 minutes until the brigands arrive and you still need to build
that net-flinging mechanical trap you've been planning out in your head.
In such a situation, you can rush your work to get it done in time.

If the crafting Specialty has a "Rushing" entry, you can reduce the time
to craft your creation by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You
can't rush a job that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop
penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting, as shown on the
following table:

Rushing also increases the opposition from an automatic success to Easy
(3D6). If you fail on a rushed crafting roll, you expend one unit of
resources as appropriate for your task
