### Success Limits

You must have at least one rank in a Specialty to be able to craft with that Specialty.
However, a single specialty rank limits the quality of the item to a
basic work. The more specialty ranks you have, the higher potential you
can create.

Each Specialty's crafting description details the success limits for
crafted items. The maximum values for Item Dice, Charm Dice, Bonus Dice,
and the Standard Opposition (for attempts to escape or undo your
creation) are shown in the following table. The applicable columns of
the table are repeated with each Specialty's crafting
description.
