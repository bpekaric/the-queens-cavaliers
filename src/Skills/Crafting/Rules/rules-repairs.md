#### Repairs

If you can create something, you can repair it as well. A damaged object
gains Malfunctions in the same way that a person gains Wounds. In terms
of game rolls, the object has a certain Drop penalty applied whenever
it's used -- Drop 1 for each Malfunction -- or one of its functions
simply stops operating.

The time to repair an object depends on the time it would take to create
a new one of the same type, as shown on the following table.

Table: Repair Time

| Base Crafting Time | Repair Time |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1 minute           | 1 minute    |
| 1 hour             | 1 minute    |
| 1 day              | 1 hour      |

You can take extra time or rush the repair if you are able to do the
same when creating the item.

As with normal crafting rolls, you automatically succeed. Each success
point gained reduces the Drop penalty by one, or restores one function
to working order. For every complete set of three Malfunctions you
repair, you have to spend 1 unit of any type of supplies that would be
used to create such an item.
