### Supplies

The raw materials used in crafting are known as "supplies". Supplies are
measured in terms of "units" -- each unit of supplies is an abstract
amount of the materials for making the simplest item of a given type.

Supplies can be purchased as shown in the following table. All supplies
can be bought in bulk, as described in Chapter 7, "Wealth
Rolls."

Table: Supplies

| Item                   | Cost | Use                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemical ingredients | 1D6  | Draughts, salves, concoctions, poison, medicine |
| Art media              | 1D6  | Works of art                                    |
| Blackpowder charges    | 1D0  | Blackpowder weapons, phlogistone components     |
| Clockwork gears        | 1D6  | Clockwork devices and components                |
| Crucible steel         | 1D6  | Weapons, armor, clockwork gears, casings        |
| Fabric                 | 1D0  | Charmweaving                                    |
| Foodstuffs             | 1D0  | Cooking, eating                                 |
| Medicine               | 1D6  | Surgery, treat                                  |
| Writing materials      | 1D0  | Reports, written works of art, battle plans     |

**Alchemical ingredients:** Chemicals, herbs, rare salts, parts of
animals, and other materials used to create salves, draughts, poison,
and medicine.

**Art media:** Supplies for creating works of art, ranging from canvas and paints to sculpturing clay and marble blocks.

**Blackpowder charges:** Units of blackpowder that can create explosive weapons or be purified to produce phlogistone.

**Clockwork gears:** The parts needed to create clockwork components that are then assembled into clockwork devices.

**Crucible steel:** Worked metal that can used to make weapons, armor, clockwork gears, and more.

**Fabric:** Cloth, lace, thread, silk, dyes, leather, buttons, and other materials for making clothing.

**Foodstuffs:** Grains, fruit, meat, cheeses, sugar, eggs, bread, and
other materials for cooking. One unit of uncrafted foodstuffs is enough
to feed one person for one day.

**Medicine:** Medicine, medicinal herbs, and other medical supplies used
to treat injuries, cure diseases, create antidotes, and perform surgery.

**Writing materials:** Paper and ink, used in creating reports, plans, and written works of art.

#### Scrounging

If you have neither the necessary supplies on hand nor the ability to
purchase more, you can spend your time scrounging -- looking in refuse
bins for art supplies, junk piles for crucible steel, discarded
trimmings for fabric, or roadkill and old fruit for foodstuffs. Every
two hours spent scrounging produces one unit of supplies -- as long as
your MJ agrees there are such supplies to be found. If you're lost in
the middle of a frozen tundra, you probably can't find blackpowder
charges just waiting for you to come along.
