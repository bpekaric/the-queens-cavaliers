### Extra Supplies

Sometimes you can spend more supplies than you need in order to craft a
superior item. You could create a larger or more ornate version of an
item, or perhaps simply make several prototypes before eventually
getting it right.

If the crafting Specialty has an "Extra Supplies" entry, you can use
more materials than needed while crafting to add a Bonus Die to your
dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in
the Specialty, as shown on the following tables:

###### Extra Supplies

| Units of Supplies | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2                 | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 3                 | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 4                 | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 6                 | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 8                 | 1D12      | \+5                     |
