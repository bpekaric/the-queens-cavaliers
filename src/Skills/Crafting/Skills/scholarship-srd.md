### Scholarship

You can craft reports and research summaries for your own use or the use
of others. Each report has to be on a very specific topic, such as
"The Effect of Piracy on French Commerce in the 15th Century."

You can also craft one chapter of a non-fiction book, with a broader
topic such as "Piracy in France" or "Economics of the 15th Century."

**Base Time:** Crafting a report takes 1 hour. Crafting a book chapter takes 1 day.

**Research Required:** You must either have first-hand knowledge of the
topic or use Culture (Scholarship) to do research of at least 1 hour for
a report and 1 day for a book chapter.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your applicable reference book or library to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Crafting a report or book chapter requires Writing materials supplies.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Culture (Scholarship).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your report by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

**Craft Book Chapter (3 units of writing materials):** You create a book
chapter about a general topic. The book has a +1D6 Item Die that can be
used in Scholarship or Knowledge rolls related to the topic.

conclusion that has eluded other scholars before you. The Item Die of
the report or chapter is maximized when used in a dice pool.
