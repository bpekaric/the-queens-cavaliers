### Calculus

You can draw plans, create algorithms, or derive theorems using the Science (Calculus) specialty.

**Base Time:** Creating something with Calculus takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your abacus or other calculation tool when using Calculus.

**Supplies:** The use of Science (Calculus) requires writing materials.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Science (Calculus).

**Extra Supplies:** You can use extra supplies while crafting to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Science (Calculus).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the creation.

| Calculus (Crafting) |                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Base Time           |  1 hour                          |
| Opposition          |  Automatic Success               |
| Item Die            |  Abacus or other calculation aid |
| Supplies            |  Supplies (varies)               |
| Bonus Die           |  Extra time, extra supplies      |

**Draw Plans (1 unit of writing materials):** You create plans for a
clockwork component or a clockwork device. The plans have a Bonus Die of
+0D6 for attempts to create that component, or assemble that device. For
every 2 success points and 2 units of writing materials you spend, the
Bonus Die of the plans improves by one die size, limited by your ranks
in Science (Calculus).

**Design Algorithm (2 units of writing materials):** You create and
write down an algorithm with an Item Die of +1D6. The algorithm is a set
of instructions for performing some task involving calculation, such as
navigation, drawing plans, or preparing a meal. (An algorithm for making
food is known as a recipe.) For every 2 success points and 2 units of
writing materials you spend, the Item Die of the algorithm improves by
one die size, limited by your ranks in Science (Calculus).

**Eureka\! Eureka\! (6 units of writing materials):** You've derived a
completely new theorem or solution to a problem, such as measuring the
volume of an object by submerging it in water. (You're not required to
run naked through the streets, though.) You need to have at least +4
ranks in Science (Calculus) for this. If you share this with other
mathematicians or scientists, they'll probably name the discovery after
you.
