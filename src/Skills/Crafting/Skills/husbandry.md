### Husbandry

You can use the Nature (Husbandry) specialty to harvest crops, slaughter
animals, prepare meals, and create leather armor and other leather
goods.

**Base Time:** Each use of Nature (Husbandry) takes one hour.

**Item Die:** You can add the Item Die of cooking utensils or a kitchen
while preparing food; and you can add the Item Die of tailoring tools
when making flexible armor.

**Supplies:** Supplies of foodstuffs are needed only if you are preparing food. Creating armor requires fabric and possibly 

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Nature (Husbandry).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to use Nature (Husbandry) by taking
a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
