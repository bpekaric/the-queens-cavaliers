# The Faris

The nomadic riders of the Ifrani desert travel between Ubar, Pitdah, Aad, and other settlements 
and oases, in tribal groups. A mounted warrior from one of these tribes is known as a faris, 
whether they ride a horse or a camel. The nearest equivalent in Elara would be a knight or
chevalier, as another type of mounted combatant.

Far from being desert savages, a Faris is a well-mannered, educated equestrian or cameleer, 
trained in matters of etiquette and peace as well as war. A number of Faris have settled in 
or nearby Pitdah where they serve as light cavalry for the khedive -- himself a former Faris -- 
and guards for caravans though the desert wastes.
