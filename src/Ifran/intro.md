Elara's neighbor to the south of the Middle Sea was the original home of the Qartan Empire.

In modern times, most of northern Ifran is a vast desert, although this was not always the
case. Legend says that as the Qartan Empire grew, so did the desert, until finally the 
desert swallowed Qarta whole and the Empire fell into ruin. There's a grain of truth to the story.

The majority of Ifran is unknown to most Elarans, who only refer to it as "The Furthest South."
It's not really the furthest south. The lust forests of Mwene Karanga gave rise to an
advanced civilization known as Mwene Karanga.
