# The Stargazer

Worship of Devra, the Desert Mother, centers on her role as queen of the night. 
The goddess is represented as the moon, while the stars are said to represent the 
spirits of departed ancestors who have gone before into the dark. This emphasis 
on the night skies has led Devrans to develop skills at astronomy far surpassing those of 
the sun-focused Asrians.

Most of these Stargazers are found in the northern Ifran city of Ubar, whose skyline 
is dominated by tall observatory towers that reach into the night. Within these towers 
can be found Stargazers focused on astronomical science, on reading the omens in the 
movements of the stars, on the development of optics and lenses, on navigation in land, 
sea, and sky, and other heavenly pursuits.
