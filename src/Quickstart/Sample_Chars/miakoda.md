:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Miakoda (Mia to her friends) was born into a small noble family whose land borders Varendia.
Her province is renowned for the tradition of falconry and quality of wool. Vialle was her
first childhood crush and would become the love of her life.

Mia joined the Cavaliers after putting down a series of Varendish bandit raids. She is rather
shy around people but this often manifests as irritation. She prefers the company of animals,
and can often be found attending to their needs when duty permits. Mia has a deep love for 
witchcraft and seeks to expand her knowledge.
