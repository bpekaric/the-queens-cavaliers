Vialle grew up on the Jeweled Coast, daughter of a mercantile family. From a young
age she was apprenticed as a Charmweaver. On a family trade expedition, Vialle met
a 13-year-old Miakoda. Subsequent trips deepened her crush to love.

Vialle originally joined the Cavaliers to be with Mia, but loved the excitement and
courtly life. Vialle specializes in making clothes for situations where armor wouldn't
be welcomed.

With a sparkle in her eyes and a gentle laugh, Vialle gets along with most people; she
feels life is too short to make trouble. She does have a serious side, expressing it in the
quality of her woven charms.
