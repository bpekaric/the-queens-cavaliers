Elspeth is a scion of a noble Albian family, the Fitz Randalls.  She can trace her family lineage 
back 600 years to a brother of Count Alain the Red.  She is 12 years old, standing at 5’1”, 
tall for her age and willowy at 100lbs, with a tow head of curls.  As she was born in the spring month 
of Floréal, her birthstone is a Sapphire that matches her eyes.  Like most Albians, she is a Dualitarian.  
Nobles of course, are all quite closely related and she is a cousin of the Prince-Consort Carolus.

Elspeth serves as a *filles d'honneur* at the court of Gallinea under the terms of the marriage agreement 
of Queen Mariana and Prince Carolus.  A fille d’honneur is a usually ceremonial position where a young 
woman of noble birth attends court as an honorary Lady’s Maid in the hopes of making a desirable match and 
learning the ways of the world.  Of course, since she is 12, she is less interested in making a match and 
more interested in learning all about… well, everything.  She lives at court in the Royal Palace and is 
in attendance at most gatherings of State having to do with Albia.  Elspeth has learned to use her 
naturally dreamy personality as a cover to appear inattentive, when she is actually observing and listening carefully.
