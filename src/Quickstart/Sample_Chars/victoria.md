In the Twenty Years' War with Albia, Victoria's daughter was drafted. At that time, she
was pregnant and on bed rest with Victoria's granddaughter, so the elder Cloutier 
volunteered to take her place. The Field Commander where she reported took one look at
her merry demeanor and the steely glint in her eye, and send her to Prince Jean-Remy,
the Queen's spymaster. He took Victoria under his wing and sent her to Varendia, where
she distinguished herself.

Victoria has since retired to Aeropa until some foolish royal cousin choked on a fishbone
and she saved them, earning an invitation to join the Queen's Cavaliers.
