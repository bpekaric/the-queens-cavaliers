## Introduction ###                                                                                    {.nobreak}

*The Queen's Cavaliers* is a tabletop roleplaying game set in an alternate fantasy France, circa the early-to-mid 1600s. 
Inspired by *The Three Musketeers* and other swashbuckling stories, *TQC*'s skill system is flexible and designed to be
entertaining, with more options than simply doing damage from round to round. Want to swing on a chandelier to gain 
advantage over your foes, or recite an epic poem to build style points? These are all valid and effective strategies in *TQC*.

Mechanically, *TQC* uses a dice pool system based primarily on your three attributes: **Verve**, **Affinity**, and **Guile**. 
Skills and specialties grant you extra dice, as do weapons and tools. *Charmwoven apparel* is unique to the setting -- 
your clothes don't just make you look fashionable but also enhance your dice pools ... assuming you don't violate the 
Laws of Fashion and end up garishly attired.

Clockwork devices are also common in the setting, with mechanician characters able to build or even invent useful gadgets 
ranging from repeating crossbows to flying airships.

Your *TQC* character is built by combining together two classes to create a unique role; with over 20 classes, that gives 
hundreds of combinations such as Duelist/Virtuosa, Brigand/Chirurgeon, Charmweaver/Witch, or Mechanician/Visionary. 
These class pairings give you a structure that speeds character creation while allowing for creative combinations to express 
your character's uniqueness.

## Quickstart Rules

### How to Play

*The Queen's Cavaliers* (*TQC*) is a Baroque, swashbuckling, clockpunk
fantasy roleplaying game for 3 or more people. One person takes the role
of the Maitresse de Jeu (MJ) or “game master,” while the others are
players.

Each player creates a player character (PC) who is (in the default
campaign scenario) a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, a group of
champions devoted to the cause of Queen Mariana of Gallinea.

The MJ creates the rest of the world, playing out the characters,
groups, and natural environment that challenge the player characters and
provide the backdrop for them to spin their own story. Dramatic
conflicts, such as feats of derring-do or swordfights, are resolved by
each side rolling dice to determine success.

To play *TQC*, you will need a copy of the Character Sheet and Combat
Tracker for each PC, and a number of six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided,
and twelve-sided dice – six of each are recommended. You'll also need
some sort of tokens such as glass beads or small coins to track each
PC's status if a fight breaks out. Pencils, paper, and note cards (3x5
or similar) are useful too.

### Creating a Character

Creating a player character takes about 30 minutes to an hour, and can
be done by the players separately before the game, or at the first game
session. 

#### For players:

Before beginning to make choices and fill in the character sheet, think
about what kind of character you'd like to make. Read over the
background information and the classes, and have a concept in mind, as
that can help you make decisions as you go through the character
creation process.

When you create your character, you'll be able to decide what she's good
at – is she primarily a swordfighter or a negotiator? A cunning sneak or
a bold ideologue? You'll want to remember that while *TQC* is a game with
romance, intrigue, and diplomacy, it's also primarily a swashbuckling
game – so you should also make sure your character can defend herself in
a fight.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For the MJ:

Tell your players a little about the type of stories that you'd like to
tell, and if there are any particularly appropriate concepts or
personality types that will work best in the scenarios you have planned,
you can suggest those as well. However, don't be afraid to just let the
players' creativity and imaginations run wild.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Attributes

Each character is described by three Attributes that describe her basic
strengths and weaknesses, as well as how she approaches life. Those
Attributes are Verve, Affinity, and Guile, and they are rated either D6,
D8, or D10.

A D10 in an Attribute indicates a high rating in that Attribute, while a
D6 indicates a low score and D8 is average. During the character
creation process, you get to choose one Attribute at D10, one at D8, and
one at D6.

#### Verve

Your character's Verve score measures her youthful exuberance, her gusto
and gumption, her joie de vivre. Characters with a high Verve are
aggressive in combat and off the battlefield as well, and usually favor
a direct, brute-force approach to solving problems. Skill specialties
related to Verve include Brawl, Lunge, Parry, Inspire, and Perceive.

#### Affinity

Affinity is your character's ability to grasp how the world operates,
both people and objects. Affinity includes a degree of intuition and
natural ability at skills; characters with high Affinity are often
builders, healers, or preservers. Aim, Treat, Intuition, Negotiate, and
Husbandry are examples of Affinity skill specialties.

#### Guile

Your character's ability to think outside of the box is represented by
her Guile: her cleverness, her ingenuity, her slyness, her brilliance. A
character with high Guile often thinks in ways that bewilder or confuse
others, and rarely favor the straightforward approach. The skill
specialties Portents, Prowl, Deduce, and Deceive are related to Guile.

### Competency Die

Each *TQC* character has a Competency Die that represents their general
level of overall skill and life experience. New player characters begin
with a D6 Competency Die; you can add your Competency Die to any skill
check in which you're trained.

As a character increases in experience, her Competency Die will slowly
increase, as explained in the later section on Experience. A player
character's maximum Competency Die is D12.

#### For the MJ: 

You can create non-player characters (NPCs) with no Competency Dice to
represent untrained characters, or characters with higher Competency
Dice to provide a greater challenge for experienced player characters. 

### Skills & Specialties

There are 12 Skills in *The Queen's Cavaliers*, ranging from Culture to
Streetwise. 

The basic level of training in a Skill is known as competency. If your
character is competent with a Skill, you get to add your Competency Die
to any rolls made with that Skill. Competency in a skill is represented
by a checkbox on the character sheet.

Once your character has competency in a Skill, you can also gain ranks
in the Specialties for the Skill.

There are three specialties for each skill, corresponding to the three
Attributes: Verve, Affinity, and Guile. For example, the Specialties for
Culture are Arts (Verve), Etiquette (Affinity), and Scholarship (Guile).

Specialties are ranked from +1 up to +5, although starting characters
can only gain a maximum of +2. Each rank represents one additional die –
of the same type as the Attribute die – that you can add to a dice pool
when attempting that skill or specialty.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character has D10 for Guile, competency with Nature, and
+2 ranks of the Prowl specialty. That means that you get to include your
Competency die in your Nature (Prowl) roll, and you get to add 2
additional D10 dice (same size as your Guile die) to the pool.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Item Dice & Charmwoven Gear

For certain skill rolls, you can add Item Dice to your pool, but only
one die per roll. The most common item dice are Weapon Dice and Armor
Dice, used in combat, but you can also get an Item Die for non-combat
rolls if you're using tools, such as chirurgeon's knives or a crowbar. 

You can also include one Charm Die in your roll. The world of Gallinea
has subtle magicks, and one common practice is the weaving of
enchantments into fashionable clothing. These Charms assist you with
specific Specialties by providing an extra die.

A charmwoven cloak may give a Dodge D6 bonus, while a cavalier hat could
provide Carouse D10.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Because you envision your character sneaking around quite
often, you buy yourself a piece of charmwoven apparel: boots that
provide a Prowl D8 bonus.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Making a Skill Roll

The primary mechanic in *TQC* is the skill roll. You make a roll by
gathering together a pool of dice and rolling them.

Your dice pool will consist of the following:

- Your relevant Attribute
- Your Competency Die, if you're competent in the skill
- One die for each rank you have of the appropriate Specialty, matching the size of your Attribute die
- One Item Die, if appropriate
- One Bonus Die, if appropriate

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You decide to use Prowl to get past a guard, so you start
building your dice pool. Prowl is a Specialty of the Nature skill, and
is associated with Guile.

The pool consists of: 

- First, your Guile D10.
- Then, because you're trained in Nature, you get to add your D6 Competency Die.
- Next, your two ranks (+2) in Prowl give you two additional dice of the same type as your Guile Attribute, so 2D10.
- No Item Dice apply, but your +1D8 Charm Die on your boots applies as a Bonus die.

Thus your total dice pool for this roll will be 1D10 + 1D6 + 2D10 + 1d6.

To see if you successfully sneak, you will roll that pool of dice. This dice pool can be abbreviated as 3D10+1D8+1D6.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Reading a Skill Roll

Once you have rolled the dice, you need to read the results. You
calculate your total by keeping the two highest-rolling dice and
discarding all the rest. Add those two dice together for the total.

The lower die from the two you kept tells you the number of Success
Points you rolled. If you succeed in your action, you can spend those
Success Points to accomplish results.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have a dice pool of 3D10+1D8+1D6.  You roll the dice and get the following results:

:::::: dice :::::
| Die  | Result |
| :--: | :----: |
| D10  | 2      |
| D10  | 5      | 
| D10  | 7      |
| D8   | 6      |
| D6   | 3      |
:::::::::::::::::

The first thing you do is discard everything except the two highest rolling dice, leaving you with 7 and 6.

- Adding those together, you get a total of 13.
- The low die, a 6,  determines the number of Success Points.

So in this case, if you succeed, you would have six Success Points to spend.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Rolling One Die

If you only roll one die, that die's number alone is the total, and your number of Success Points is always one.

### Drop Penalties

A Drop penalty is an adjustment to the number of dice you roll, based on
a negative or hindering quality affecting your character. The most
common Drop penalties are the results of Wounds, Combined Actions, Range
Penalties, or General Modifiers. 

Drop penalties are expressed as “Drop X,” where X is the number of dice
you must drop from your pool before rolling. “Drop 1” means to remove
one die, “Drop 2” means remove two dice, and so on.

When you drop dice, you get to choose which ones to drop. In nearly
every situation you're going to be dropping your dice with the smallest
size first, so D6 before D8, D10 before D12.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have a dice pool to roll for Prowl: 3D10+1D8+1D6.
However, you are suffering two Wounds, giving you a Drop 2 penalty. You
drop the D8 and the D6, leaving 3D10.

You roll those dice, getting the following results:

::::: dice ::::::
| Die  | Result |
| :--: | :----: |
| D10  | 2      |
| D10  | 3      | 
| D10  | 7      |
:::::::::::::::::

These total to 10, with three potential Success Points.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Opposition Dice

Whenever you make a Skill Roll of any kind, you are making an opposed
check – either against an opponent or against Standard Opposition dice.

When facing an opponent – such as trying to negotiate against someone or
stab them with a sword – the opponent gets to make an appropriate
defense or opposition roll. This is dependent upon the situation; for a
Negotiate roll, the appropriate opposition is likely another Negotiate
roll, while a Lunge can be opposed by a Parry, Block, or Dodge.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* While Prowling around, you fail a roll and are spotted by a
guard. She demands to know what you're doing and if you're supposed to be 
there. You aren't actually supposed to be there, so you need to make up a
story to convince her. This requires the use of the Deceive specialty.

Deceive is a Guile specialty under the Interaction skill, and you're
competent with Deceive. You have 1 rank in the Deceive specialty. 
In addition, you have a charmwoven hat with a Deceive +1D6 Charm Die.
Your dice pool is 1D10 + 1D6 + 1D10 + 1D6, or 2D10 + 2D6.

The opposition dice will be the guard's Intuition roll. The guard has an
Affinity of D10, a D6 Competency Die, and +1 rank in Intuition. Her dice
are 1D10 + 1D6 + 1D10, or 2D10 + 1D6.

You roll 2D10 + 2D6 and get 9, 3, 2, 3 for a total of 12 with three success points.

The MJ then rolls for the guard's Intuition specialty and gets 6, 2, and 5. 
Her total is 11 and her success points are five.

Because her total is lower than yours, you succeeded on your Deceive roll
and she buys your story.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Standard Opposition

If you are making a roll which isn't opposed by another character (PC or
NPC), the MJ will roll Standard Opposition dice – such as if you are
walking a tightrope, picking a lock, or reciting a poem.

The number of Standard Opposition dice is always three, but the type of
dice vary depending on the difficulty level set by the MJ.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For the MJ: 

Select the size of dice to roll by consulting this table:

Table: Difficulty Level

| Difficulty Level | Standard Opposition |
| :--------------- | :------------------ |
| Very Easy        | Automatic success   |
| Easy             | 3D6                 |
| Moderate         | 3D8                 |
| Difficult        | 3D10                |
| Very Difficult   | 3D12                |

A Very Easy task should automatically succeed; they just happen,
especially if they fit the genre of the game.

You can use Standard Opposition dice in a number of situations in which
you don't have a specific NPC opposing an action. If a PC is trying to
influence a crowd, just choose 3D6 or 3D8 to represent the difficulty in
influencing the crowd.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Spending Success Points

Once you have succeeded at a skill roll, you can spend your Success
Points to produce results.

Each Specialty has one or more associated Success Tables. This is what
the Success Table for Deceive looks like:

::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::
| Deceive     |                    |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| Time:       | Free Roll          |
| Opposition: | Intuition          |
| +:          | Think on Your Feet |
| ++:         | Appear Sincere     |
| +++:        | Gain 1 Style Point |
| ++++:       | Appear Trustworthy |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can spend your Success Points and achieve the desired results. Each
“+” indicates the expenditure of one Success Point. 

The results you can achieve are dependent upon the shared reality of the
fictional world. In other words, if there's no way you can convince the
guard that your lie is true -- for example, if you told the guard that you're
her sister and she clearly knows her own family -- then you can't choose to
appear trustworthy. A Deceive roll isn't mind control!

If applicable and appropriate, you can choose a result more than once.
It doesn't make sense to appear sincere twice, so you can't
choose that multiple times, but if you had the success points you could
gain mutiple style points.

It's possible that you may run out of things to spend Success Points on.
In such a case, the extra points you don't spend are simply unused and go away.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have three Success Points and succeeded on your Deceive roll.
You decide to spend your Success Points as follows:

- +: Think on Your Feet -- you quickly come up with a good lie.  "I'm the ... inspector!  I'm here to inspect ... all the things!"
- ++: Appear Sincere -- you don't seem like you're obviously lying, so the guard believes you.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Style Points

Style Points are a limited resource which you can use to improve your
dice rolls. You start each game session with one Style Point and can
gain more by spending Success Points with successful skill rolls. Three
Success Points will earn you one Style Point. However, you can only have
a maximum of three Style Points at any time.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You score six Success Points on a Deceive roll, and spend your Success
Points like this:

- +: Think on Your Feet
- ++: Appear Sincere
- +++: Gain 1 Style Point
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Every time you gain a Style Point, you are required to describe what
your character has done that is particularly stylish. You can't overly
bend the narrative of the game – your stylish description can't have any
mechanical effect – but you can use the opportunity to make your
character perform an impressive act that is unique to her personality
and style.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You choose to Think on Your Feet, Appear Sincere, and Gain 1 Style Point. The MJ
asks you, “what do you do that's so stylish while you're tricking the guard?" You answer:

"I give a dashing and reassuring smile as I tell this outlandish lie, a sparkle
of moonlight reflecting off my teeth with a 'glint!' sound. With confident 
assurance, I tell her that I'm here to perform an inspection, and I even hint
that if she doesn't comply, she may be in trouble with her superiors."

“Awesome\! That happens,” says the MJ. And you earn your Style Point.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For the MJ:

It's perfectly within your rights to veto any stylish description if you
think it's too absurd, but most of the time you should let players get
away with whatever they want to describe. It's their Style Point and
thus their chance to narrate.

The only time that you should definitely step in is when you feel a
description isn't stylish *enough.* Then you can prompt the player for
more awesomeness and encourage them toward an over-the-top, flamboyant
display.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Style Maneuvers

Each player character starts with two Style Maneuvers and can purchase
more with Experience Points. Style Maneuvers each cost one or two Style Points to use.

Unlike *gaining* Style Points, you are not required to narrate something
stylish when you *use* a Style Maneuver (but you can if you want to\!).

There are three types of Style Maneuvers: Maximize, Reroll, and Add.

#### Maximize (Specialty)

This Style Maneuver lets you spend two Style Point, then take one of the
Specialty Dice of the appropriate Specialty and set that die to its
maximum value before rolling. You don't roll that die, just set it to
its highest value and set it aside, then include it after you roll.

You can only have one maximized die in any given skill roll. (You can't
spend two Style Points and maximize two dice.) 

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have the Style Maneuver “Maximize Deceive.” You can spend two
Style Points to set one of your D10 dice to its maximum value before
rolling. That gives you an automatic 10 on that die. You then roll the other
dice -- 1D10 + 2D6 -- getting a 2, a 3, and a 2. 

Adding the 10 to the 3, you get a total of 13 with three success points. Nice!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Reroll (Skill)

This Style Maneuver lets you reroll a roll that you just made. Spend a
Style Point, pick up all the dice (except maximized dice, of course) and
reroll them.

You can reroll the same skill roll as many times as you like, until you
run out of Style Points.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You make your Deceive roll and get 4, 2, 3, and 2. That's really
low -- a total of 7 with 3 success points. 

You have a Style Maneuver “Reroll Interaction.” You spend a Style Point and
reroll the dice, and get a much better roll: 7, 9, 2, 6.  Hooray\! 
This is a total of 16 and seven Success Points.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Add (One Specialty) to (Another Specialty)

This Style Maneuver lets you add your Specialty dice to another roll.
You add only the Specialty dice – of the same size as the first
Specialty's related Attribute.

You can only use each Add Style Maneuver once per roll, although you
could use additional, different Style Maneuvers together on the same
roll if they all apply.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have a Style Maneuver that lets you add your Banter dice
to your Deceive roll. Normally your Deceive roll is 2D10 + 2D6.
You have +2 ranks in Banter (a Verve specialty), and your Verve is D8,
so you get to add 2D8 (not your entire Perceive dice pool) to your Deceive
roll. 

Your Deceive dice pool is now 2D10 + 2D8 + 2D6. You roll the dice and get
4, 9, 8, 2, 4, and 3.  Hooray\! This is a total of 17 and eight Success Points.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Experience

Each game session of *The Queen's Cavaliers* gives you three to five
Experience Points (XP), which you use to improve your player character.
The cost for each improvement is shown in the following table.

Table: Character Improvements

| Character Improvement      | Cost                  | Notes                  |
| :------------------------  | :-------------------: | :--------------------- |
| New Skill Competency       | 3 XP                  |                        |
| Specialty Rank, per rank:  | Equal to the new rank |                        |
| \+0 to +1                  | 1 XP                  |                        |
| \+1 to +2                  | 2 XP                  | (3 XP from +0 to +2)   |
| \+2 to +3                  | 3 XP                  | (6 XP from +0 to +3)   |
| \+3 to +4                  | 4 XP                  | (10 XP from +0 to +4)  |
| \+4 to +5                  | 5 XP                  | (15 XP from +0 to +5)  |
| New Language               | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Weapon Prowess             | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Armor Prowess              | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Add a Style Maneuver       | 5 XP                  |                        |

Note that there is no cost listed for improving your character's
Attributes\! Your Attributes are fixed for the life of your character as
they represent innate qualities unique to her. If you have a D6 Verve at
the start of your career with the Queen's Cavaliers, you'll have a D6
Verve at the end.

Once you have spent (not earned, spent) a certain number of Experience
Points on improvements, your character's Competency Die will improve, as
shown on the table below. In addition, the maximum number of ranks your
character can have in any one Specialty increases.

Table: XP and Competency Die

| XP Spent | Competency Die | Maximum Specialty Rank |
| :------: | :------------: | :--------------------: |
| 0        | D6             | \+2                    |
| 20       | D8             | \+3                    |
| 50       | D10            | \+4                    |
| 100      | D12            | \+5                    |

Experience points can be spent between game sessions, at the beginning
of a session, at the end of a session, or between scenes. You can't
spend your experience points during a scene, however.

::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For the MJ:

The XP system is flexible and relies on your judgment as to how many
points to award per session, although the default is three XP to five XP
for a typical session of four hours of game play.

In general, you should only give out XP at the end of a session, not
immediately after each scene.

### Demo Adventure: Nice Day for a White Wedding ## {.breakbefore}

This is a sample adventure that can be used by starting players and MJs to
introduce the world and the game rules.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
**Summary:** In the high mountains of Varendia, a small group of Cavaliers
must prevent a kidnapping and save a marriage. This demo is designed for
two to six players and is designed to show both social skill use and a
thrilling combat.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Briefing

Read or summarize the following information:

Piers de Montambre, the youngest son of Marquise Deina de Montambre, is
engaged to Hans von Stimmt, the youngest son of Landgraf Heinrich von
Stimmt. Both families approve of the marriage, which will further cement
ties between the two cities on opposite sides of the Lendine Mountains.

Landgraf von Stimmt is seeking allies in his conflicts with his fellow
Varendish lordlings, while Marquise Deina looks for new markets for
Montambre's iron and steel.

As the Marquise de Montambre is a strong supporter of Queen Mariana of
Gallinea, you have been sent to accompany her and Piers as honor guards
at the wedding and the reception that follows. The wedding will take
place in a chateau overlooking the von Stimmt lands.

Before you leave, a covert messenger sent by Prince Jean-Remy, the
Queen's spymaster, tells you that rumors are swirling that someone in
Varendia may be hiring mercenaries to disrupt the ceremony. The Landgraf
has dismissed those rumors as baseless, but you'd best be on your guard
anyway\!

##### Additional Background Details

You can summarize this information or provide it to your players if it
becomes necessary.

  - Varendia is a patchwork of small kingdoms and duchies who rarely
    manage to work together on much of anything, as they are busy
    jockeying for power and wealth in internal struggles.
  - Landgraf von Stimmt is currently vying for control over the
    Nebelwald, a large forest nestled against the Lendine Mountains. His
    chief rivals include Altgräfin Bridlin von Wolkenburg and Herzog
    Rein Bärenlied, neither of whom are present at the wedding.
  - Piers and Hans met while both were studying in Lutetia, the capital
    of Gallinea, and by all accounts are in love -- it's not just an
    arranged political marriage.
  - Montambre doesn't have any real enemies, but Marquise Deina is not
    on good terms with Comtesse Josette of the nearby town of
    Canard-Noir.

#### Dramatis Personae

  - Deina de Montambre (Gallinean; female; 49 years old; Loyalty (D10),
    Family (D8), Country (D6)): Marquise of Montambre, mother of groom
    Piers, and loyal supporter of Queen Mariana of Gallinea.
  - Esdeline Bissette (Gallinean; female; 31 years old; Wealth (D8),
    Lust (D6)): Consort of Marquise Deina for the last 9 months; not of
    noble birth.
  - Greta Valliken (Varendish; female; 21 years old; Pride (D10),
    Loyalty (D8), Wealth (D6)): Airship captain, mercenary, and pirate.
  - Hans von Stimmt (Varendish; male; 21 years old; Love (D8), Knowledge
    (D6)): Youngest son of Landgraf Heinrich von Stimmt and groom of
    Piers de Montambre.
  - Heinrich von Stimmt (Varendish; male; 52 years old; Family (D10),
    Wealth (D8), Pride (D6)): Landgraf (duke) of Stimmtburg, father of
    groom Hans, and one of several Varendish nobles with claims on the
    Nebelwald forest.
  - Othilia von Stimmt (Varendish; female; 54 years old; Family (D10),
    Pride (D8), Love (D6)): Wife of Heinrich and mother of groom Hans.
  - Piers de Montambre (Gallinean; male; 22 years old; Love (D8),
    Justice (D6)): Youngest son of Marquise Deina de Montambre and groom
    of Hans von Stimmt.

##### Not Appearing In This Adventure

  - Bridlin von Wolkenburg (Varendish; female; 69 years old): Altgräfin
    (arch-duchess) of Wolkenburg and a rival of Heinrich von Stimmt.
  - Jean-Remy de Gallinea (Gallinean; male; 49 years old): Prince of
    Gallinea, Queen Mariana's favorite uncle, and spymaster.
  - Josette de Canard-Noir (Gallinean; female; 29 years old): Comtesse
    of Canard-Noir and an economic competitor of Marquise Deina.
  - Rein Bärenlied (Varendish; male; 34 years old): Herzog (duke) of
    Bärenlied castle and city, and a rival of Heinrich von Stimmt.

#### The Wedding

Surprisingly, the wedding goes off without a hitch. It was a lovely
ceremony, performed by a Varendish priestess of Eserre, the sun
empress-goddess of the Asrian faith. The ceremony took place behind the
chateau in a picturesque meadow, and then the attendees moved inside for
the reception.

#### The Reception

Now, this is where things begin to happen\!

Lay out index cards as Areas to represent the sections of the ballroom
in the chateau where the reception is being held. The dancing floor
should be in the middle, and the balcony beside it, opposite the
entryway.

  - **The Grooms' Table:** Piers and Hans are seated here, along with
    Landgraf Heinrich, his wife Othilia, Marquise Deina, and her consort
    Esdeline Bissette. Attendees approach the table to offer their
    well-wishes to the happy couple, who are dressed in matching white
    formal outfits trimmed with their respective family colors (gold and
    brown for Montambre, green and brown for Stimmt). The nobles are
    getting along well with each other.
  - **Dining Tables:** This is where most of the people who attended the
    wedding are seated. Most of the people here are from Varendia,
    although some have traveled from Gallinea with the Cavaliers and the
    Marquise.
  - **Ballroom Floor:** An open space in the middle of the ballroom where
    the grooms can dance, as well as anyone else who feels like doing
    so.
  - **Chamber Ensemble:** There are six musicians sitting here, playing
    mostly Varendish songs with a few well-rehearsed Gallinean pieces as
    well. Cavaliers who are skilled at music may be asked to play a song
    with the ensemble.
  - **Balcony:** This is open to the chill spring air, overlooking the
    valley below the chateau. Stubborn patches of snow still cling to
    the nearby mountainsides, and far below the lights of a village,
    Stimmtburg, can be seen flickering in the darkness. The moon is full
    but partially hidden by the clouds of the night sky.
  - **Entryway:** There are two Varendish guards here, one man and one
    woman. They are tall, strong, silent, and completely humorless. They
    wear steel breastplates, iron helmets, and green/brown Stimmt
    tabards.

Ask the players where they are and place markers or tokens to represent
their locations on the index cards. Also place markers for the two
grooms, the Landgraf, the Marquise, and the two guards.

Allow the players to do whatever they want at the reception, and then
require a specialty roll to demonstrate how specialty rolls work. Here
are some examples of how you might resolve certain actions.

Interacting with nobles, including the grooms and their families, should
require a Culture (Etiquette) roll. Remember to add a cavalier's highest
social rank die to the roll as an item die. The standard opposition dice
are 3D8 for the groom's table, and 3D6 for any other guest.

To dance well, a cavalier will need to make a Culture (Arts) roll. The
standard opposition is Easy (3D6) unless the cavalier ends up in a
dance-off with someone. A cavalier who is a musician and who has her
instrument with her may be asked to join the chamber ensemble.

Mingling with the crowd to get information or just find a companion for
the evening is a Streetwise (Carouse) roll, with standard opposition of
Easy (3D6) if the character speaks Varendish, and Moderate (3D8) if not.
Some rumors or secrets include:

  #. The Landgraf recently canceled an order of steel breastplates from Canard-Noir (true; common rumor, or uncommon secret) 
  #. Three of the serving staff were hired a month ago (true; rare rumor or uncommon secret) 
  #. Someone in Stimmtburg was asking about mercenaries a few weeks ago, which admittedly isn't all that uncommon for Varendia (true; common rumor, or rare secret) 
  #. The marquise's consort is actually a spy in the employ of Prince Jean-Remy (false; common rumor) 
  #. The musicians were chosen because of their repertoire of Gallinean belle danse music (false; rare rumor) 
  #. Hans broke off an engagement with a duke's daughter to marry Piers (false; common rumor)

Remember that rumors could be true or could be false, while secrets are
always true. You can provide additional rumors or secrets at your
discretion.

Looking around and generally being on guard can be any Observation
check, against Easy (3D6) standard opposition. Alternately, a Knowledge
roll with an appropriate skill could suffice as well. Some of the things
a cavalier might notice: 

  #. The cellist is not as good as the rest of the musicians, and missed a few notes here and there
  #. There are 8 different members of the serving staff who move around delivering food and drinks, and carrying off empty plates
  #. The guards did pause to eat some strudel given to them by some serving staff
  #. There is a cold breeze blowing over the balcony and the sky above is getting cloudier, blocking out some stars
  #. The marquise's consort, Esdeline, looks bored and her bearing marks her as a non-noble
  #. The wine is mostly imported from Gallinea and was brought by the marquise.

Not all of these observations are important. You can feel free to add
additional details from the information given in the adventure, or just
make things up.

Bribing the serving staff for information or favors requires a
Streetwise (Larceny) roll with standard opposition of Moderate (3D8),
but also add the cavalier's highest Social Rank die to the opposition --
they're more willing to talk to other members of lower ranks than to
nobles. Use Carousing results to determine what kind of information is
given. You can decide if the staff member being addressed is a normal
server or an infiltrator (see below), based on what will make for a more
interesting story.

Try to give each player the chance to make at least one roll, preferably
something they're good at. Encourage the purchase of style points, and
make sure each character gets a close-up scene whenever they gain a new
style point.

#### The Action Begins\!

At an appropriate time, start the action part of the scene. It may
happen because a cavalier spots something while investigating, or you
could just choose to have it happen once each player has had her
cavalier do something useful. You can also start this part by having
Piers and Hans take to the center of the ballroom for a dance.

By this time, the guards are getting sleepy and starting to slump
against the wall, an unspeakable breach of duty under most
circumstances. They've been poisoned and are taking a Drop 2 penalty on
all actions; the cavaliers will be the heroes today, not the guards.

Have the cavaliers make simple Observation rolls against Easy (3D6)
standard opposition to see if they notice what's going on before it
happens. Each cavalier who succeeds can take a Drop 1 action -- moving
to a different area or drawing her weapon, for example -- before the
fight begins.

For every cavalier present, there will be one infiltrator -- a mercenary
who has been hired to capture Hans and take him out to the balcony. For
example, with four cavaliers playing, there will be four infiltrators.

The cellist is an infiltrator, and if there are more than four
cavaliers, so is the oboe player. They draw swords and pistols from
their instrument cases, surprising the other musicians. Represent these
with the Brash Fencer opponent, although they don't have bucklers so
remove a D8 from their Defense (Block) pools.

Up to three of the serving staff can draw knives out of hidden sheathes
in their sleeves and start waving them around; use the Street Thug to
represent these opponents.

If you need another infiltrator, one of the minor nobles present is
actually an Unemployed Thespian passing herself off as a visitor from
Gallinea. Nobody's actually heard of her before
this.

Table: Opponent Summary

| Players     | Opponents                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 cavaliers | Cellist (Brash Fencer), Server (Street Thug)                         |
| 3 cavaliers | Cellist, 2 Servers                                                   |
| 4 cavaliers | Cellist, 3 Servers                                                   |
| 5 cavaliers | Cellist, Oboe Player (Brash Fencer), 3 Servers                       |
| 6 cavaliers | Cellist, Oboe Player, 3 Servers, "Minor Noble" (Unemployed Thespian) |

The nobles and guests present, including the grooms, won't join the
fight -- they're non-combatants and mostly drunk, so it's up to the
cavaliers to be heroic. If you need stats for any of them, you can use
the Gossiping Courtier, the Boorish Fop, or the Petty Noble. The guards,
drugged as they are, are represented by Infantry Recruits. 

The sound of fighting can be heard further back in the chateau; these
two guards aren't the only ones present, and a group of infiltrators has
been dropped off to engage them and draw the other guards off. The plan
was made assuming that only the two drugged guards would be present --
the infiltrators weren't planning on the Queen's Cavaliers attending the
reception\!

The infiltrators won't directly engage with the cavaliers unless
attacked first; instead they are trying to move Hans out to the balcony.
A brawl roll against Hans' Military (Brawl) of 1D8 should be easy
enough, or you can move him around via fiat. Don't make it too hard, but
try to get him at least onto the balcony.

#### The Airship Arrives\!

At the end of the first or second round of the fight, an airship comes
down from the clouds above the chateau. It'd been waiting around, high
above the chateau, and is there to carry Hans off. Add a Deck of the
Airship index card to the scene. (The airship also potentially has a
Below Decks area and an Atop the Airship Balloon area, if you need to
add extra index cards during the fight.) Anyone falling off the balcony
or the airship dies unless they're the cavaliers, Hans, or the airship
captain -- in which case they catch themselves at the last second and
dangle precariously unless rescued.

There are ten crewmembers -- Bloodthirsty Buccaneers all of them -- but
not all of them can fight the cavaliers since they're busy sailing the
airship. One crewmember will fight, and an additional crewmember equal
to half the number of cavaliers, rounded up. They'll use their pistols
unless the cavaliers come onto the airship. If the fighting members of
the crew and the captain are defeated, the rest of the airship crew
surrenders.

The captain of the ship is a Varendish pirate named Greta Valliken. If
there are three or fewer cavaliers, she is a Devious Smuggler; if there
are four or more, she is a Privateer Captain. Her goal is to capture
Hans, so she won't fire the cannons on the ship toward the chateau, nor
will she take actions that might endanger Hans.

Greta's motivation can be any of the following:

  - She was hired by Altgräfin Bridlin von Wolkenburg to disrupt the
    wedding, forcing the Landgraf to give up some of his claim to the
    Nebelwald as ransom
  - She was hired by Comtesse Josette de Canard-Noir to kidnap Hans, as
    a form of revenge against the Landgraf and the Marquise for a
    canceled order of armor that instead went to Montambre
  - She is Hans' childhood "girlfriend" who he hasn't thought about in
    fifteen years, but is crazy enough to believe that he "promised" to
    marry her when they were both five years old
  - She is a rogue airship captain who just hopes to make some money if
    she steals away Hans, and she heard about this wedding while she was
    in Stimmtburg fencing her stolen cargo

Choose one that makes sense based on the facts that have been revealed
through roleplaying before the fight began. You can make the motivation
a mystery that the players can solve -- the first two choices -- or you
can have a somewhat silly out-of-the-blue motivation with the
"girlfriend" choice. The last option is probably the least interesting,
but it's there if you need it. In any case, have Greta make her
motivation clear as she tries to get Hans onto the airship.

#### Resolution

The cavaliers really should triumph here, defeating the mercenaries and
Greta, and saving Hans. They're rewarded by both families and poems are
composed telling of their bravery.

If, for some reason, the players fail to win the day, you can have Piers
join the fray, rescuing Hans but not defeating Greta -- leave that to
the cavaliers, or have her escape (although that's less
satisfying).

## Character Creation

### Summary {.nobreak}

To make your own character for *The Queen's Cavaliers*, follow these instructions
while filling out the character sheet.

#### Competency Die, XP, & Yield Limit

As a starting character, you have a D6 competency die and
you start with 0 XP earned, 0 XP spent. Your Yield Limit equals the
maximum value of your Competency Die plus 3, so 9 for a starting
character.

#### Choose Two Classes

Your character is a composite of two classes. For each class chosen, record the following information:

##### Skills & Specialty Ranks

Your classes determine your starting Skill Competency and your
Specialty ranks. For each skill listed, check the corresponding box to
indicate Competency. For each Specialty listed, place a +1 in the
appropriate blank space; if both classes give ranks in a specialty,
write +2.

##### Weapon & Armor Prowess

Your Weapon prowess & Armor prowess are the total of those
granted by your two classes. Check the boxes on the character sheet that
correspond with all of your Weapon and Armor prowesses.

##### Social Rank & Wealth

For each of your classes, record the Social
Rank and the die for each rank. For example, if your two classes give
the social ranks Commoner (1D0) and Soldier (1D6), you'd write down
“Commoner (1D0)” and “Soldier (1D6).” Also record the dice values on the
Wealth section of your character sheet, along with your Competency Die.
Your total Wealth Roll consists of those three dice together in a pool.

The social ranks are:

- Commoner (D0)
- Soldier (D6)
- Artisan (D8)
- Noble (D10)
- Royalty (D12)

##### Bonus Gear

Each class provides you with a set of clothing and possibly additional equipment.

##### Style Maneuvers

Choose one Style Maneuver from each class and record it on your character sheet.

####  Attributes

Your attributes are Verve, Affinity, and Guile. Assign one of
them the value D10, another one D8, and the last D6, and write those in
the appropriate boxes. You probably want to put the D10 in the attribute
that corresponds to the column where you have the most Specialty ranks,
but it's not required.

#### Nationality & Languages

Choose and record your nationality.

If you are from Gallinea, you speak and read Gallinean; if not, you
speak your native language automatically and don't know Gallinean
(you'll need to learn it with one of your customizations; see step 10).
For each prowess rank you have in Culture (Scholarship), you speak and
read an additional language. Record each language that you know.

#### Passions & Personifications

Choose four Passions for your character that describe what she
feels is important in her life. The standard Passions are Artistry,
Church, Country, Faith, Family, Friends, Justice, Knowledge, Love,
Loyalty, Lust, Pride, and Wealth. You will rank your four chosen
Passions from D12 (the strongest) to D6 (the weakest).

:::::::::::::::::::::::: optional :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Optional:* For each Passion, name one person associated with that passion
and record that person's name to the right of the Passion. This is the
person (living or dead) whom your character most closely associates with
that Passion, either positively or negatively. You can use an existing
NPC (or even PC), or name a new one.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### 5. Customizations

You get to choose up to six customizations for your character. Choose
your six customizations from the following list (you can choose each
customization more than once):

- Increase one of your Social Rank values by one step; you can increase each Social Rank die only once.
- Add one Weapon or Armor Prowess.
- Add a new Language.
- Add one Skill Competency.
- Add +1 rank in a Specialty, to a maximum of +2.
- Add a Style Maneuver from either of your classes or from your Nationality.

#### 6. Additional Equipment

You begin with bonus gear as determined by your
class listings. You also get your choice of one weapon: Knife, Pistol,
or Sword.

You begin the game with three Rewards – one of them equal to your
Competency Die, and the other two equal to your Social Rank Dice. You
can buy additional equipment by using these Rewards – for example, a D8
Reward can be used to purchase any item of cost D8 or lower.

If you don't want any of your starting gear, you can sell it back and
gain an equivalent Barter Die. For example, if you don't want a musket
(Cost: 1D10), you can trade it in for one D10 Barter Die. You can't make
any Purchase rolls or use your Barter Dice during character creation,
but you can spend your Rewards.

#### 7. Character Details

 Write down a name, gender, and other biographical data
for your character. Write down two or three words for your character's
Reputation, such as “Fearsome Opponent,” “Mostly Harmless,” or “Renowned
Lover.” Your reputation need not be true.


### Passions {.breakbefore}

Characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are passionate, and their passions
often spur them on to fantastic success or dismal failure.

Each character is defined by four Passions that are ranked with Passion
Dice, from D12 at the highest, down to D10, D8, and D6 at the lowest.
The size of each Passion Die indicates the relative strength of that
Passion in the character's life.

You must always have one passion at D12, one at D10, one at D8, and one
at D6, and they must all be different Passions. (You can't double up
with the same Passion with two different dice sizes.)

In addition, each of your Passions is embodied by another character,
living or dead, as the Personification of that Passion in your character's mind.

#### Using Passions

You can use your character's Passions when roleplaying, by making
decisions that reflect the role her Passions play in her thoughts.

In addition, Passions can also be used with Style Points for game
benefits. Passions can be used in one of three ways:

- Indulge your Passion during a scene to gain 1 Style Point.
- Add your Passion die to a roll by spending 1 Style Point.
- Struggle with your Passion to make it harder for you to succeed at something -- and when you fail, you gain a free Style Point.

##### Indulge Your Passion

During a scene, if your character takes the time to focus on her Passion
to the exclusion of other activities, you can gain 1 Style Point – but
only up to the normal maximum of three Style Points at any one time. You
can only do this once per Passion, per session.

For example, someone whose Passion is their Faith may engage in prayer,
while another person who has a Passion for Knowledge may engage in
scientific discovery or reading a new book.

As with any time in which a Style Point is gained, you must describe how
your character is acting with style.

##### Add Your Passion Die

By spending a Style Point, you can add one Passion Die to a Dice Pool
under the following conditions:

- Your Passion must be related to the roll that you are making.
- You have not already added that Passion to a die roll in this session.

You need to have a good reason why your success or failure hinges on
your character's Passion – for example, perhaps your character is
motivated to succeed because of her sense of Pride, or her desire for
more Wealth. If you can't justify how your character's Passion would
influence the outcome, you can't spend the Style Point and can't include
your Passion Die.

##### Struggle With Your Passion

Sometimes your character's Passion isn't a benefit, but is a hindrance.
In such cases you can choose to struggle with that Passion by adding the
appropriate Passion Die to the opposing Dice Pool when the MJ makes a
dice roll.

If your roll then fails, you gain 1 Style Point and get to describe how
your character's Passion conflicted her and caused her to fail. If your
roll succeeds, you don't gain this Style Point.

You can only choose to do this when the roll is related to your
character's Passion, as with adding the Passion Die to your own roll; in
addition, you can only do this once per Passion per session.

#### Inverted Passions

Sometimes, one's love for something can be twisted into pain. These are
known as inverted passions; rather than being passionate toward the
object of your Passion, you're opposed to it.

You decide when you select a Passion whether it's normal or inverted.
You probably shouldn't have more than one inverted Passion for a
starting character, although your Passions may become inverted during
the course of game play. (See "Changing Passions", below.)

#### List of Passions

The following is a list of the most common Passions that drive
characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*. You can pick from this list or
write your own custom Passion.

Several of these Passions require additional definition, such as
specifying the Country that you're passionate about, or the group you're
loyal to. You can record this beside the Passion die on your character
sheet

##### Artistry

A character with a Passion for Artistry is drawn toward things of
beauty, be they works of art, music, science, or nature. Such characters
are often either artists themselves, or patrons of the arts.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Countess Lusienne Castenia, the Lady-Mayor of Gallinea,
loves nothing more than a grand party to welcome the start of a new
play, the opening of a new gallery, or the arrival of an artiste from
far-away lands. She has a strong Passion for Artistry, even though she
herself is not artistically talented.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Artistry, Inverted:** The ugliness of your soul drives you to destroy
things of beauty rather than cherish them.

##### Church

A character with a Passion for the Church is devoted to the hierarchy of
a religious institution, most commonly the Asrian church under the
direction of the Matriarch.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example-illustrated :::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: thumbnail-right ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Guardian Farrazin, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/guardian-farrazin.jpg "Guardian Farrazin, by Eleanor Ferron")
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* High Chaplain Farrazin, Guardian of the Faith of Gallinea,
is a very devout man, yes. But ultimately his loyalty is less to the
teachings of the goddess Essere than to her church. Raised in an Asrian
orphanage, Farrazin rose through the ranks to become the most powerful
chaplain in Lutetia -- and there's nothing he won't do for the Church of
Essere.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Church, Inverted:** You despise all that the Church stands for, seeing
them as one of the greatest threats to your life and those of others.

##### Country

Passion for one's Country is usually, although not always, the same as a
Passion for the ruler of that country. The Passions may conflict if one
has Loyalty toward one group or cause who opposes the current
government.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Baudouin de Longpre, the duke of Rhodope, is one of the
rare male heads of a province. As the oldest child of his parents, who
had no daughter to inherent the throne, he became duke upon his mother's
death. The Rhodope family have supported the Throne for generations;
they were loyal to the late Queen Elisse III and remain steadfast
loyalists to her daughter, Queen Mariana II. The crown is more than the
head that wears it.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Country, Inverted:** Your country has done you wrong -- either through
deliberate malice or "benign" neglect. Your ire may be directed against
all people of that nation, or just against the ruling parties.

##### Faith

As contrasted with Passion for the Church, Passion for one's Faith is
less about the religious organization and more about the beliefs. It's
possible (and quite common) to have both Passions, or also to have just
one or the other.

Devrans usually have a Passion for Faith but no Passion for the Church,
because worship of the Desert Mother isn't based around a complex church
hierarchy as with the Asrians.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Matriarch Isabene de la Justicia, Bride of the Sun, is the
head of the Asrian church -- some say she practically *is* the church.
However, her strongest commitment is to her deity and (ceremonial) wife,
Essere, goddess of the Sun.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Faith, Inverted:** You reject the Faith that once filled your heart
with joy. No longer a true believer, you work to convert others to leave
that religion just as you have.

##### Family

Characters with strong familial ties have a Passion for Family. This can
include one's extended family and household, or may just be one's
immediate family – such as parents or children.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Prince Jean-Remy is not merely Queen Mariana's favorite
uncle, but is also Gallinea's spymaster and head of Her Majesty's Secret
Service. Haunted by his failure to detect and thwart the assassination
of his sister Queen Elisse and niece Jehanne, Jean-Remy would do
whatever it takes to prevent harm to any of his family.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Family, Inverted:** You're the one decent person in a family of
terrible people -- or perhaps the only terrible person in a family of
saints. You're determined to prove to your kin that they were always
wrong about you.

##### Friends

Some people are very faithful to their Friends and would do anything for
them – even die for them in some cases. You can decide if this applies
to all your character's friends or just her closest friends.

::::::::::::::::::::: example-illustrated ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: thumbnail-right ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Gabriana Secouriste, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/gabriana-secouriste.jpg "Gabriana Secouriste, by Eleanor Ferron")
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Gabriana Secouriste is a young member of the Queen's
Cavaliers. Personable and easy-going, she makes friends easily and is
slow to lose them.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Friends, Inverted:** You keep to yourself and don't form any
friendships. Why? Because at one time in the past, you felt horribly
betrayed by someone you trusted, and it's hard for you to call anyone
"friend" again, no matter how nicely they're acting.

##### Justice

The cause of Justice is a higher calling to right that which is wrong in
the world. The Passion may stem from an innate sense of right and wrong,
but more commonly it is a reaction to some act of terrible injustice
that has been perpetrated against the character or the ones she holds
dear.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Andreos Grimani, the High Elector of Ekalia, began his
public service as a member of the Vigiles Urbani in his home polis of
Imera. He went on to become a judge, before retiring to enter politics.
First elected to the Plenum 15 years ago, he became the ranking Elector
of Imera, then the Senior Elector of Justice, and finally the High
Elector -- a position he has held now for three years. Andreos is known
for his strong drive toward justice as well as his detailed knowledge of
the laws of Ekalia and neighboring countries.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Justice, Inverted:** The concepts of fairness and justice are a lie
designed to keep us all docile sheep. Flaunting the law through blatant
displays of criminal activity is your favorite way to subvert the status
quo.

##### Knowledge

Dedication to the pursuit of Knowledge can be expressed through a desire
to learn the truth behind mysteries, to explore the world, or to learn
all that can be learned.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example-illustrated ::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: thumbnail-left :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Queen Mariana III of Gallinea, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/queen-mariana.jpg "Queen Mariana III of Gallinea, by Eleanor Ferron")
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* As a princess, Mariana of Gallinea was much more interested
in scientific pursuits and clockwork engineering than she was in courtly
rituals and noble intrigues. She was a top student at the Royal
Gallinean Academy of Sciences when her mother and older sister were
assassinated, forcing her to take up the Crown. In truth, she'd really
rather be in a laboratory than in the royal palace.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Knowledge, Inverted:** There are some things that the common people
were not meant to know. Only you can be fully trusted with these
secrets, and you'll do what's necessary to stop that Knowledge from
falling into the wrong hands.

##### Love

Romance is the most common expression of a Passion for Love, although
there are other types of Love that qualify. Love may be for a single
person, or someone's heart may be divided among many loves.

:::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Prince-Father Michel Aubene, the widower of late Queen
Elisse III and father of current Queen Mariana II, was very much in love
with his wife, and she with him. When they first met, she was not
impressed with the rich southern boy who came to "play cavalier" in
Lutetia and guard then-Princess Elie. After she saved him during an
attack on her life, love soon blossomed. Even the dark bonds of death
can't quell the love Michel feels for Elisse.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Love, Inverted:** Love hurts, scars, wounds, and marks. You knew you'd
never love that way again, and now you're all out of love. All you want
is someone who won't hurt you, won't hurt you no more. But does that
person even exist?

##### Loyalty

The Passion of Loyalty is about dedication to a specific person or
group. You must specify who is the subject of your character's Loyalty
if you choose this Passion. You might not actually like the people
you're loyal to, but this isn't about friendship but honor.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example-illustrated :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: thumbnail-left :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Martine Deveaux, by Eleanor Ferron](assets/Portraits/martine-deveaux.jpg "Martine Deveaux, by Eleanor Ferron")
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Martine Deveaux was once a faithful and loyal member of the
Queen's Cavaliers, willing to die for the organization and those within
it. After a disastrous mission with the Cavaliers where she was made the
scapegoat, she turned on her former companians. Now a mercenary
assassin, Martine hates the Cavaliers as much as she used to love them.
This is now an example of an inverted passion.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Loyalty, Inverted:** You can't trust anyone. They might demand your
loyalty or pledge it to you, but no one is actually faithful. Be on
guard, for anyone may betray you at any time.

##### Lust

The Passion of Lust is about following one's baser desires, usually
expressed through sexual pleasure. Characters who are Passionate about
Lust can be flirty, teasing, or promiscuous.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Genevieve de Longpre, eldest daughter of the Duke of
Rhodope, is renowned for her string of love affairs -- most of which
ended poorly. It's said she has at least one girl in every port, and
perhaps even more\! Hopefully they won't all meet at the same time.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Lust, Inverted:** Actually, it's about ethics in sexual relationships.
You're one of the good people, and yet the objects of your desire keep
gravitating away from you and toward inferior mates\! They'll pay for
making you involuntarily celibate.

##### Pride

A Passion for Pride means a character is highly focused on her own
dignity and reputation. Affronts to such Pride are met with strong
challenges, as such things are not to be tolerated.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Although only 13 years old, Prince Philippe of Gallinea has
more pride than an entire village of Scanbrians. The youngest grandchild
of late Queen Elisse III and nephew of the current Queen, he firmly
knows he is the most important person in Lutetia, save his aunt Mariana.
And sometimes even more important, he believes.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Pride, Inverted:** Life feels like a succession of failures, but
that's okay -- you deserve such misery, right? The best you can hope for
is to scrape by, surviving. Sure, it would be really nice if things
turned around, but how likely is that to happen?

##### Wealth

Individuals with a Passion for Wealth are focused on the acquisition,
maintenance, and spending of sums of money. Some come from poor
backgrounds and wish to move beyond their humble beginnings, while
others are rich misers who count every penny.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Jennevive d'Angelet is the Duchess of Scanbria and head of
the richest family in the north of Gallinea. She and her husband, Lord
Gerhardt, are well-known throughout the City of Scanbreille for their
parsimonious ways, although rumors circulate that she is saving up for a
major purchase. What that might be, no one is sure.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Wealth, Inverted:** Money? Who needs money? It just leads to
temptation. You give all of yours away as soon as you get it, usually to
worthy charities or individuals. You might even steal from the wealthy
to give to the impoverished.

#### Personifications

A Personification is someone who represents, to that character, the
associated Passion – for good or for ill.  

For example, someone with a Passion for family may think of her beloved
mother who taught them how to hunt – or she could think of her
overbearing grandfather who always demanded more than she could provide.
Someone with a Passion for Country could be intensely loyal to the Queen
herself, or could idolize a revolutionary writer from last century.

Personifications are a way to tie your character to the world and
provide the MJ with non-player characters for you to interact with. A
Personification could be living or dead, an existing NPC or a completely
new one created by the player.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10, Country D8, Love D6.

Her Personification of Loyalty is Sir Pierre du Prowe, an older member
of the Queen's Cavaliers who taught her how to swordfight. Dani's Pride
is personified in her rival, Elise Raymonde, another cavalier recruit
whose skill with the blade matches her own. For Country, Dani looks to
the Queen of Gallinea herself, Marianna, as embodying all that is good
and right in her home nation. And for Love, she can't help but think of
the peasant girl Hersent who she grew up with, her first crush.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MJ's Toolbox: Passion Rolls

In addition to using Passions to earn or spend Style Points, you can
have players make a Passion Roll at the beginning of a game session.
Such rolls give hints as to what is on the character's mind at the
moment and a way to challenge that character's motivations in a
meaningful way.

To make a Passion Roll, a player rolls all of the dice for her Passions
– a D6, a D8, a D10, and a D12. The die that rolls the highest
indicates which Passion is in play for that session.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10,
Country D8, Love D6. She rolls her Passion dice, getting these results:

:::::::::::: dice :::::::::::
D12: 5, D10: 7, D8: 6, D6: 3
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The high roll is the 7 and it's on the D10. Her D10 Passion is Pride,
which means that Dani may face a situation where her Pride is tested.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the simplest things to do is to have the player's Personification
of that Passion make an appearance, or a story hook related to that
Personification. In some cases it may not be possible – such as a
long-dead grandparent – but even then, it pays to get creative. Maybe
the character finds a long-lost letter, meets up with an old enemy of
her grandparent, or even has a portentious dream about her ancestor.

The Passion Roll is a tool for improvising roleplay and shouldn't be
seen as a constraint on your storylines – you can make the result of the
roll as important or unimportant as you wish.

If your style as an MJ runs toward planning instead improvisation, you
can have your players make Passion rolls at the end of a game session
and use the results to decide what plot elements to introduce in the
next game.

In an ongoing campaign, it's likely that the same Passion will come up
repeatedly. You can ameliorate this effect by removing from the pool the
die corresponding to whichever Passion came up in the immediately
previous session. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Changing Passions

During your character's life experiences, her priorities may change.
After a game session you can make one of the following changes based on
what happened during that session:

  - Swap two "adjacent" passions, such as your D12 Passion and your D10 Passion.
  - Invert one of your Passions.
  - Revert one of your inverted Passions.
  - Change out your D6 Passion for a Passion you don't already have.

When you swap, invert, or revert your Passions, your Personifications
may or may not change; it's up to you to decide.

### Experience Points

Each session of *The Queen's Cavaliers*, the MJ awards experience points
based on the following table. If faster progression is desired – for
example, in a campaign with limited sessions – the MJ can increase the
rewards by a factor of up to three.

Table: XP rewards per session

|                        |                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------: |
| Base Per Sesssion      | 1 XP per session |
| Each Major Scene       | 1 XP per scene   |
| Storyline Resolution   | 1 XP             |
| Faster Leveling        | x2 or x3         |

You can spend your experience points to add new abilities to your
character or improve current abilities, as shown on the table below. You
must have Competency in a Skill to increase your Specialty rank, and
your Style Maneuvers can be chosen from your own classes, from your
National Styles, or from other classes with the MJ's approval. Your
Specialty ranks cannot be increased beyond +2 until your Competency Die
increases (see the following section).

Table: Character improvements

| Character Element          | Cost                  | Notes                  |
| :------------------------  | :-------------------: | :--------------------- |
| New Skill Competency       | 3 XP                  |                        |
| Specialty Rank, per rank:  | Equal to the new rank |                        |
| \+0 to +1                  | 1 XP                  |                        |
| \+1 to +2                  | 2 XP                  | (3 XP from +0 to +2)   |
| \+2 to +3                  | 3 XP                  | (6 XP from +0 to +3)   |
| \+3 to +4                  | 4 XP                  | (10 XP from +0 to +4)  |

## Classes

Your character in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a composite of two classes.
Each class provides you with half of your starting skill competencies,
specialties, weapon and armor prowess, social rank, starting gear, and
style Maneuvers.

The various classes can be divided up into three basic categories:
skilled classes, social classes, and fighting classes. These are shown
on the following tables.

For the most well-rounded character, choose a fighting class and either
skilled or social class; that way, you'll be effective in a fight as
well as outside of one. Duelist is a good choice for a fighting class,
if you can't find another that doesn't really fit.

If you are mainly interested in creating things or helping people, you
can choose one skilled class and one social class, or two skilled
classes.

To make a mostly social character, choose a social class and a skilled
class, or two social classes.

Finally, if you want to build a character who excels at combat but not
at much else, choose two fighting classes.

You don't have to choose your classes if you don't feel inspired;
instead you can roll 1D8 for each one. Feel free to reroll if you don't
like your original results\!

choose one of these classes.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Class Descriptions


### The Duelist

A Duelist is a swashbuckling swordfighter who lives by her wits and her
skill at her blade. She may be a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, or a
rival organization, or may be a freelance fencer who runs her own
dueling school. Quite a few actors have been known to take up dueling as
well.

Duelist is appropriate to accompany any other class in *The Queen's
Cavalier.* As swordfighting is so prevalent in the game, the Duelist
class is a natural choice for most appropriate character concepts.
That's why they're presented out of alphabetical order here.

In other words, if you can't decide on a second class, choose Duelist.

Using techniques perfected in the old Qartan Empire, Alchemists brew

Barristers have special training in the law and court procedures, and
are skilled at speaking before a magistrate.

Some Barristers work for the Crown and prosecute lawbreakers, while
others can be hired by those with enough money – usually only the rich.
A recent and controversial policy in Gallinea allows for the indigent
poor to be represented by public defenders, paid for by the Crown.

### The Brigand 

While Gallinea and most of the Elaran continent are long-settled, that
doesn't always stop opportunists from engaging in banditry. The typical
Brigand in Gallinea is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes
fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.

Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there's a long history of folk
heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the
poor.

### The Chaplain 

A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian.
The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among
military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal
training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.

Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the
goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Achalia are also found as
Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Achalian Islands. Devraist
priests are known as Speakers, and it's rare to meet a Devraist
Chaplain. Dualitarian Chaplains are sometimes co-classed as Speakers,
however.

### The Charlatan 

Charlatans are swindlers, confidence men, mountebanks, and other

enchantments into fabrics. Most are skilled fashion designers and can
combine their artistic and magickal talents together into impressive
displays.

Charmweaving began in Gallinea and has spread throughout Elara in the
last century, as popular fashions with practical charms became

called upon to heal battlefield injuries, such as musket wounds or
arrows to the knee.

Chirurgeons often wear black bird-headed Plague Masks when treating
their patients; many of these are charmwoven to improve their surgical
skills. Chirurgeons are not adverse to using magicks when appropriate,

investigate crime, and the Crown Barristers who prosecute the offenders.
The Constables – and their counterparts in neighboring countries –
enforce the laws and protect the people from wrongdoers as well as
capturing those who commit criminal acts.

Most Constables are employed by the Crown or a local province, while a
few have retired and ply their trade as investigators for private hire.

### The Courtier

Members of the Gallinean royal court, and other noble courts, are
Courtiers. They are well-educated, trained in etiquette and social
graces, and have preternatural skill for plotting and intrigue.

Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only
continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their
matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may
return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.

Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some
martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their
leisure.

### The Dogsbody

A Dogsbody is a common manservant or henchperson, one who assists
another in their escapades and only rarely comes up with a cunning plan.

known world. Explorers are alternately courageous or foolhardy depending

### The Provincial 

Outside of the cosmopolitan sprawl of Lutetia are the provinces of
Gallinea – home to commoners and petty noblefolk, many of whom lack
education and refinement. These Provincials – and the Provincials of
other nations – are looked down on by the city folk.

Provincials who come to Lutetia often feel they have something to prove
when dealing with residents of the capital city; it's not uncommon for
brawls to break out in bars because someone's clothes or horse was
insulted.

A few Provincials are minor nobles and choose the Courtier co-class,
although they rarely are afforded the respect given to their urban
cousins.

### The Provocateur 

A revolutionary, a spy, an assassin, a traitor, a conspirator – these
are terms used to speak of the Provocateur, a shadowy figure enmeshed in
plots within plots. Provocateurs are used by all nations of Elara,
although they are rarely trusted even among those who employ them.

A typical Provocateur does not advertise her profession, so she will
usually rely on her co-class for her public persona. 

- **Suggested Classes:** Charlatan, Courtier, Duelist, Envoy, Speaker, Visionary

### The Speaker

A Speaker is an adherent of the Desert Mother, Devra, whose purpose in
Gallinea is to convert the masses. Devraism is legal within Gallinea but
is in conflict with the majority Asrian religion. For this reason,
Speakers usually keep a low profile while spreading their messages of
stoic living and opposition to secular authorities.

Few, if any, Speakers are loyal to the Gallinean crown; Speakers are
usually opponents for the Queen's Cavaliers rather than allies.

### The Veteran 

Gallinea and its neighbors maintain standing armies, composed of
professional soldiers who fight in their wars at home and abroad. The
most recent war between Gallinea and Albia lasted for a total of 20
years, ending 6 years ago with the marriage of then-princess Mariana
(now Queen Mariana) to prince Carolus of Albia.

Veterans of that and other wars are well-trained in the art of battle,
and if not currently part of a military unit, often join mercenary
companies or guard regiments rather than settle down into a civilian
lifestyle.

art, music, or drama. Virtuosas can be singers, actors, painters,

Being an effective Virtuosa requires training in the arts and history,

person. True Renaissance women and men, they are able to apply logic and
science ways that seem almost supernatural to many.

A Visionary may be a leader, or she may be a quiet follower who only
seeks to pursue her life's work. Visionaries are usually well-educated
and can speak confidently on a variety of topics.

Gallinea are experts at folk remedies, herbal lore, midwifery, and
reading omens. Witchcraft is officially tolerated in Gallinea, although
most devoutly religious people eschew contact with Witches unless
absolutely necessary.

Some Witches are publicly known as such, but most keep their rituals
secret from the authorities, remembering past periods of persecution.

### Variants: Alternatives to Classes ## {.breakbefore}

You don't have to make your character with classes; here are three options that you can try, with your MJ's permission!

#### Option: Random Backstories ## 


This is an optional method of character creation that allows you to roll
randomly on a series of tables (or, with your MJ's permission, pick from
the lists) to determine your character's backstory, starting skills, and
proficiencies.

This system replaces the part of the character creation process where
you choose two classes.

When you gain a specialty, you also gain competency in the appropriate
skill. For example, if a result reads “Culture (Scholarship +1),” you
gain competency in the Culture skill if you didn't have it before, and
you gain one rank in the Scholarship specialty.

As a starting character, you are limited to a maximum of +2 ranks in any
specialty. If a random roll would increase your ranks to +3 or higher,
the additional points are added to your customizations which you can
spend later in the character creation process.

Because you don't have a class, you can't spend your customizations on
additional style maneuvers during the character creation process, apart
from national styles. (When you gain enough XP, you can take any style
maneuver later.)

##### Regional or National Origin

Roll 1D12 to determine where you were born, your native language(s), and

Example of Backstory-Based Character Creation

Dani decides to roll up a character using the optional random backstory
system instead of choosing two classes.

###### Regional or National Origin

Dani rolls a 12 on the table, meaning she's from Varendia. She adds the
Varendish language and the skills Military and Nature to her character
sheet.

###### Parentage

With a roll of 8, one of Dani's parents was a retired Cavalier. She adds
the Gallinean langague, skill competency in Dueling, one rank in Lunge,
prowess with swords, and the style maneuver Confident Fencing to her
character sheet. She also sets her D6 passion to Loyalty.

Dani also has to answer the question, “What notable deed did your parent
perform in the name of the Queen?” Dani decides that her mother stopped
an Albian airship from bombing Castenia during the Twenty Years' War.

###### Pivotal Event of Childhood

Rolling a d8, Dani gets a 1, and finds that someone in her family died.
She decides this was her father, and that his unexpected death caused
her to grow up quickly. She adds one rank to Intuition, and sets her D8
Passion to Family.

In answer to the question “What did your relative tell you before they
died?” Dani decides that her dying father told her to never turn her
back on someone in need.

###### Education

Dani rolls a result of 11 on the education table, meaning that she
attended the royal universities in Lutetia. This gives her the Gallinean
language, but she already speaks it. She also gains competency in
Culture; one skill rank each in Etiquette, Scholarship, Negotiate, and
Deduce; Knowledge as a D10 passion; and the Cunning Erudition style
maneuver.

To answer the question “Why did a stranger pay for your expensive
education?” she decides that the Duchess of Castenia paid for her
education in recognition of her mother's bravery during the last war.

###### Pivotal Event of Adulthood

Dani rolls a 1 on the final table, getting “Clandestinely Recruited.”
This gives her competency in Medicine and Streetwise, and one rank each
in Deceive, Prowl, Poison, and Carouse. She also gains Country as a D12
passion and Do You Expect Me To Talk? as a style maneuver.

“What have you learned that makes you mistrust your superiors?” Dani
distrusts her superior because she has been asked to spy on her fellow
members of the Queen's Cavaliers.

###### Backstory Summary

Dani was born in Varendia to a Gallinean mother and a Varendish father.
Her mother had distinguished herself during the war between Albia and
Gallinea, and when she had completed her duty to the Queen, she married
a man in Varendia and settled down. Tragically, Dani's father passed
away when she was young and she was raised by her mother.

Dani returned to Gallinea when she was old enough to study at the royal
universities in Lutetia, with her education paid for by a grateful noble
who remembered her mother's courage. Upon graduation, Dani was accepted
into the Queen's Cavaliers as a new recruit, and was also contacted by
Prince Jean-Remy, the Queen's uncle and spymaster, and asked to report
back to him on the actions of her fellow cavaliers.

character to fit the concept she'd like to play. Dani can also spend her
starting Rewards on additional gear (plus gets a simple weapon for
free).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


#### Option: Playing Without Classes ## {.breakbefore}

You don't even have to play with classes (or backstories) at all. The MJ
might allow this option if she wants everyone to have the most
flexibility in creating their characters.

A base character starts with the following:

  - Skill Competency in Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and
    Observation.
  - One language.
  - Knife Weapon Prowess.
  - Social Rank of Commoner (D0)/Commoner (D0).
  - One outfit and one common weapon.
  - 30 customizations, replacing the 6 customizations that characters
    normally receive.

You can use those customizations in the following ways:

  - Add Competency in any one skill.
  - Add +1 rank to any Specialty which you have the related skill
    competency. Limits: You can't have more than +2 ranks in any given
    specialty. You can't assign more than eight ranks to the specialties
    corresponding to each attribute (Verge, Affinity, Guile).
  - Add one language.
  - Add one armor prowess or weapon prowess.
  - Increase one of your social ranks by 1, to a limit of Noble
    (D10)/Artisan (D8).
  - Add one style maneuver of your choice. Limits: You can have a
    maximum of six style maneuvers.

Once you have assigned your customizations, you receive four rewards
equal to your Competency Die, two rewards equal to your lowest rank, and
two rewards equal to your highest social rank. You can spend those
normally to buy your starting equipment.

Example of Class-Free Character Creation

advanced technology). This uses four of her customizations.

**Specialty Ranks:** Morgan picks Parry +1 (mid-air swordfights\!),
Dodge +1 (mid-air gun fights\!), Aim +1 (also mid-air gun fights\!),
Strategy +2 (airship tactics), Explore +2 (navigating), Blackpowder +1
(firing cannons\!), and Clockworks +2 (fixing a broken airship). She
also chooses Scholarship +1 (mainly for geographic knowledge), Etiquette
+1 (customs of far-off lands), Inspire +1 (officers should be inspiring,
right?) and Perceive +1 (for looking through a spyglass). Adding up the
totals for each attribute, she finds +6 ranks total for Verve (Parry,
Explore twice, Blackpowder, Inspire, Perceive), +4 ranks total for
Affinity (Aim, Etiquette, Clockworks twice), and +4 ranks for Guile
(Dodge, Strategy twice, Scholarship). This is under the limit of eight
ranks per attribute, so she's good there. This costs 14 of her
customizations.

**Languages:** Morgan decides she will be from Albia, and thus her free
language is Albian. She also gets a bonus language from her +1 rank in
Scholarship, and she picks Gallinean. She decides to also learn Ekalian
(because many sailors are from Ekalia) and Varendish (because the best
cannonsmiths hail from Varendia), and that uses up two more
customizations.

**Armor or Weapon Prowess:** While she doesn't think she needs armor
prowess, Morgan does want to know how to use Swords, Pistols, and
Cannons. She spends three customizations on those.

**Social Rank:** Figuring that airships are rather expensive to
maintain, Morgan pushes her social ranks up to the maximum of Noble
(D10)/Artisan (D8). This uses five of her customizations, and she's only
got two left from the original 30.

**Style Maneuvers:** Looking over the list of style maneuvers<a href="#style-maneuvers" class="xref-inchapter"></a>, 
Morgan finds two that thinks will be most appropriate for a future
air-captain like herself. She selects Powdersmith (when creating or
repairing a device with a blackpowder flintlock power source, a
phlogistone furnace power source, or an explosion component, spend 1
Style Point to add Blackpowder dice to a Clockworks roll) and Naval Hilt
(when using a cutlass, spend 1 Style Point to add Explore dice to a
Parry roll). This uses up her last two customizations.

**Starting Equipment:** Naturally, Morgan chooses to start with a corsair outfit,
and for her free weapon chooses a cutlass. She receives rewards of 4D6
(from her Competency Die), 2D8 (her Artisan social rank) and 1D10 (her
Noble social rank). It's not quite enough to buy an airship, so she
instead buys a cutlass (1D6 cost), a mariner's astrolabe (1D6 cost), a
spyglass (1D6 cost), repair tools (1D6 cost), a double pistol (1D8 cost)
because it's cool, and a deck cannon (1D10 cost) since she always wanted
a cannon. Doesn't everyone? This leaves her with a 1D8 reward, which she
chooses to spend on four supplies of clockwork gears so she can repair
an airship or make nifty toys.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


#### Option: Creating a Custom Class ## {.breakbefore}

If only one of the classes appeals to you, you can create a custom class
with the MJ's consent. (Having two custom classes is not recommended;
choose one standard class in addition to your custom class.)

Make the following choices and write them down:

**Name and Description:** Decide what role the class will play in
Gallinean, Elaran, or Ifran society. How is this class different from
existing classes?

**Suggested Classes and Passions:** Choose at least 3 suggested classes
and passions that fit the class concept. **Limit:** You can't choose
Duelist as one of the classes.

**Social Rank:** If the class is primarily focused on combat, then the
Social Rank should be Soldier (D6). If the class requires formal
education or apprenticeship, then the Social Rank should be Artisan
(D8). Otherwise the class should probably be Commoner (D0). **Limit:** A
custom class can't be Noble (D10) or Royal (D12) social rank.

**Specialties and Skill Competency:** Choose six different specialties
that make sense for the class; these all gain +1. The Skill Competencies
correspond to those specialties, with the exception of skills that
everyone is already competent in using. **Limits:** Classes never give
specialty ranks in Initiative. Each attribute (Verve, Affinity, Guile)
can have at most 3 specialties associated with it.

**Weapon and Armor Prowess:** If the class would know how to use
specific weapons or armor types, pick up to four of those, total.
Remember that everyone already knows how to use a Knife.

**Bonus Gear:** Choose one outfit that the class will receive for free.
If the class requires the use of one or more tools, pick one of those
tools as well as 4 supplies of the appropriate type. If the class has
weapon or armor prowess, choose up one weapon and one type of armor.
Remember that everyone gets one common weapon for free.

**Style Maneuvers: **Choose six style maneuvers from the list of style
maneuvers that are appropriate for this class: two that allow a reroll
of one skill, two that allow one die to be maximized on a specialty
roll, and two that let you add dice from one pool to another under
specific circumstances.

When you've finished creating your class, let your MJ review it to see
if it fits her concept of the world and the campaign. She can provide
suggestions on how you can modify the class if she sees potential
problems with the class.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MJ-Created Classes

MJs, you can create classes too, and offer them as additional choices
for your players. You should try to follow the general guidelines given
for players, although you can customize the social rank, bonus gear,
armor prowess, and weapon prowess. You shouldn't give a class specialty
ranks in Initiative, and a class shouldn't have more than 8 style
maneuvers.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Skills and Specialties

There are 12 skills in *The Queen's Cavaliers*, ranging from Culture to
Streetwise. Each of these skills has three specialties, corresponding to
the three Attributes of Verve, Affinity, and Guile.

#### Using Skills

To use a skill, first you determine under which specialty the task you
want to perform falls. Your dice pool starts with one die of that
specialty's corresponding attribute; this is your Attribute Die.

If you have competency in that skill, you can add your Competency Die to
the dice pool. There are four skills that all player characters are
competent at using: Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and Observation.

You can have +0, +1, +2, +3, +4, or +5 ranks in each specialty, although
a starting character is initially limited to only +2 ranks. Each rank
adds an additional die of the same size as your Attribute Die to the
dice pool; these are your Specialty Dice.

Many specialties allow you to add an Item Die from a tool or item to the
dice pool as well, as described under the separate listings for each
specialty. Weapon Dice and Armor Dice are subcategories of Item Dice;
you can only add a Weapon or Armor die if you have prowess with that
weapon or armor. You can have only one Item Die in any given dice pool.

You might have a Bonus Die that you can include in your dice pool under
certain circumstances. Tag Dice and Advantage Dice are subcategories of
Bonus Dice. A Tag Die is temporary and is based on a word, a phrase, a
person, a place, a thing, or a concept. Your Advantage Die is used in
combat, and can progress from +1D6 up to +1D12. You can only have one
Bonus Die in a dice pool.

Factors that make your skills harder to use assign a Drop Penalty to
your dice pool. Such factors range from Wounds to language barriers.
Each Drop Penalty specifies a number of dice that are dropped -- meaning
removed -- from your dice pool before you roll. A Drop 2 penalty means
you remove 2 dice. You can choose which dice to drop, and so you're
going to want to drop the smallest size dice.

Once you've finished constructing your dice pool, you roll all the dice
at once. You select the dice that resulted in the highest two numbers,
and you discard the results of the other dice. Then you see what the MJ
rolls on the opposition dice.

There are two types of opposition dice. Some are rolls of your
opponent's corresponding specialty, such as her Defense (Parry) roll
against your Dueling (Lunge) roll. In other situations you might be
rolling against standard opposition, rolled by the MJ. Standard
opposition pools consist of three dice of the same size, from Easy (3D6)
to Very Difficult (3D12).

Table: Standard Opposition

| Difficulty | Opposing Dice Pool |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Very Easy  | Automatic success  |
| Easy       | 3D6                |
| Moderate   | 3D8                |
| Hard       | 3D10               |
| Very Hard  | 3D12               |

The total of your roll is the sum of the two dice you kept after
rolling. The success points generated by your roll equal the lower of
the two dice. If you beat the total of the opposition dice, then you can
spend those success points on the success table for that specialty.
Otherwise, your opponent can spend her success points.

You can usually buy a result from a success table multiple times, unless
it says otherwise in the description of the specialty. Success points
you don't use are simply discarded when you finish buying the results
you want.

One of the most common ways to spend success points is to buy a style
point for 3 success points. You use style points to power your style
maneuvers, which let you combine together the Specialty Dice of two
different specialties, set one die in a pool to its maximum value before
you roll, or reroll a result that you don't like. You can only have 3
style points at a time, so if you already have 3, you can't buy any
more.

The skills, specialties, and their corresponding attributes used The
Queen's Cavaliers are shown in the following table:

Table: Skills and Specialties

| Skill       | Verve Specialty | Affinity Specialty | Guile Specialty |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Culture     | Arts            | Etiquette          | Scholarship     |
| Defense     | Parry           | Block              | Dodge           |
| Dueling     | Lunge           | Riposte            | Feint           |
| Initiative  | Impulse         | Vigilance          | Timing          |
| Interaction | Inspire         | Negotiate          | Deceive         |
| Magicks     | Weave           | Brew               | Portents        |
| Medicine    | Surgery         | Treat              | Poison          |
| Military    | Brawl           | Aim                | Strategy        |
| Nature      | Explore         | Husbandry          | Prowl           |
| Observation | Perceive        | Intuition          | Deduce          |
| Science     | Blackpowder     | Clockworks         | Calculus        |
| Streetwise  | Banter          | Carouse            | Larceny         |

Skills and Specialties are described below, with a Success Table for
each Specialty. You gain a set of skills and specialties from each of
your classes (or backstory), and additional skills and specialty ranks
from customizing your character. As you gain experience points, you can
spend XP to increase your ranks in your specialties, or add new skills.

The Success Tables that follow are meant to be a guideline for you and
the MJ to determine what happens based on any given roll. They are not
meant to override the fictional narrative; a result can only happen if
it makes sense in the context of the story.

At the MJ's discretion, a different table can be used for any Specialty
– or a result from any Success Table – for the price of one additional
Success Point. This allows for flexibility in player actions by
comparing against similar tasks, and using those results.


### Generic Success Tables ## {.breakbefore}

The following Success Tables can be used in lieu of, or in addition to,
the specific Success Tables for each Specialty. The results should be
used loosely and with discretion, as some results might not be justified
based on the fictional context.

#### Non-Combat Skills in Combat

This table can be used to represent Skills which aren't normally
intended for a fight (i.e., not Defense, Dueling, Aim, or Brawl) but
which end up being used anyway. For example, a Mechanician might attempt
to overload one of her devices or a Virtuosa could sing loud enough to
shatter glass.

**Opposition:** The opposition dice can be anywhere from Easy (3D6) to
Very Difficult (3D12) depending on the MJ's assessment of the situation.
Alternately, the target can defend with an appropriate Defense
specialty, if the MJ decides the Skill use is similar to an attack.

::::::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Any Skill         |                                            |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Time:             | 1 action                                   |
| Opposition:       | Standard Opposition or Applicable Defense  |
| ++:               | Inflict 1 Yield                            |
| +++:              | Reduce Yield Taken                         |
| +++:              | Increase Advantage                         |
| +++:              | Gain 1 Style Point                         |
| +++++:            | Inflict 1 Wound                            |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every two Success
Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Reduce Yield Taken:** If you have taken Yield, you can reduce it by
spending three Success Points per point of Yield.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more
Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

#### Knowledge Rolls

Use this table for general knowledge rolls – for example, if a character
with ranks in Science (Clockworks) is trying to recall the name of a
famous Mechanician or a Chirurgeon is remembering the facts about a
disease. Each Specialty has one or more examples of knowledge rolls that
can be made with that Specialty, although the lists are not exhaustive.
MJs and players should be creative in how they use Specialties to make
knowledge rolls.

**Opposition:** Characters automatically succeed on Knowledge checks, and
the success points generated indicate how much information they're able
to recall.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::
| Knowledge     |                            | 
| :------------ | :------------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll                  |
| Opposition:   | Automatic Success          |
| +:            | Recall Common Knowledge    |
| ++:           | Recall Uncommon Knowledge  |
| ++++:         | Recall Rare Knowledge      |
| +++++:        | Recall Unique Knowledge    |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Recall Common Knowledge:** You can recall basic facts about the topic,
enough to hold a simple conversation about it.

**Recall Uncommon Knowledge:** You are aware of some things that aren't
common knowledge about the subject.

**Recall Rare Knowledge:** You know something about the subject that
only comes from deeper study or experience.

**Recall Unique Knowledge:** You have firsthand knowledge of something
about the topic that only a few others share.

#### Standard Opposition Results

These results can be used by the MJ when a player's roll against
Standard Opposition dice fails. As with other generic result tables,
these should be used with discretion, as not all results will fit the
fictional circumstances.

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition is only rolled in response to an
action taken by a player character. If the Standard Opposition roll
beats the action's roll, the MJ may spend the Success Points on this
table, as well as declaring the action invalidated.

::::::::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::
| Standard Opposition |                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| Time:               | Free Roll                |
| Opposition:         | Specific Specialty Used  |
| +:                  | Increase Difficulty      |
| ++:                 | Inflict 1 Yield          |
| ++:                 | Increase Tension         |
| ++:                 | Mysterious Omen          |
| ++:                 | Delayed Gratification    |
| +++:                | Grant 1 Style Point      |
| +++:                | Rude Interruption        |
| ++++:               | Unnecessary Distraction  |
| ++++:               | Challenge a Passion      |
| +++++:              | Incredibly Bad Fortune   |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Increase Difficulty:** Step up one of the dice used in the roll, if
the player character (or an ally) attempts the same task. For example,
if the Standard Difficulty was Moderate (3D8), with one Success Point
you could step up one die, making it 1D10+2D8 on subsequent attempts. If
you spend three Success Points, step up all three of the dice.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** If the player character is attempting something
physically, mentally, or emotionally taxing, you can choose to inflict
Yield on her. Each additional two Success Points inflicts an extra point
of Yield.

**Increase Tension:** You gain a D6 Tension Die if you don't already
have Tension, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of
D12. Describe how the tension in the current situation increases based
on the player character's failure at the task.

**Mysterious Omen:** Something ominous happens, perhaps foreshadowing a
future event. Players can attempt a Portents roll if they wish to try to
interpret the omen.

**Delayed Gratification:** The player character (or an ally) cannot make
another attempt at the same task until a certain amount of time has
passed. If the task normally takes one round, she must wait for a
minute; if a minute, then for an hour; if an hour, then for four hours;
if four hours, then for a day.

**Grant 1 Style Point:** Assign a Style Point to one of your non-player
characters, usually a Minor or Major Opponent. Minor Opponents can have
up to three Style Points, Major Opponents can have up to six Style
Points, and other characters can have only one Style Point.

**Rude Interruption:** The player character fails to complete her task
because someone rudely barges in, interrupting her. Choose one of your
existing NPCs or create a new character to intrude on the character;
this could even be a hostile opponent, although not a Major Opponent.
She won't be able to resume her task until she manages to send away the
intruder.

**Unnecessary Distraction:** An event happens nearby that distracts the
player character, causing her to fail on her attempt. This could be a
loud noise outside, a sudden wind blowing around some papers, a horse
that decides to bolt, or an attractive person passing by. If the player
character (or an ally) attempts the task again, she gets a Drop 2
penalty on the roll.

**Challenge a Passion:** Choose one of the player character's Passions,
and a way in which it becomes challenged. Perhaps the Personification of
the Passion appears (as an NPC), or the player character remembers
something about that Personification (if not able to appear in person).
Maybe the situation changes so that the player character has to choose
between her values and succeeding at the task. Be creative\! The game
result is that if the player character attempts the task again, add her
Passion Die to the Standard Opposition dice on subsequent tries.

**Incredibly Bad Fortune:** Something goes disastrously wrong. A ship at
sea gets lost, a device being created explodes, a gun misfires, the
guards show up at the wrong moment, or the player character trips and
falls in front of an audience. The exact details are up to you, but they
should be serious without being directly deadly and possibly very
embarrassing. The player character can attempt the task again one she
recovers from the effects of her terrible luck.

### Culture ## {.breakbefore}

The Culture skill includes arts, history, religion, language, mythology,
music, customs, traditions, noble families, and other societal elements
found in the cultures of Elara and Ifran.

The Culture specialties are often used as knowledge rolls.

#### Arts

*Verve Specialty*

Sculpture, music, painting, poetry, sketching, woodcuts, writing, dance,
acting, and other forms of art are used to convey the core values of
Elaran society. The Arts specialty includes not just basic knowledge of
artwork, but also the ability to create works of art and to perform
creative works.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a piece of art, spot a forgery, remember
the name of a famous artist, identify tools and instruments used in art
or music.

**Crafting:** Create works of art such as drawings, poetry, paintings,
sculptures, plays, songs, opera, novellas, and more<a class="xref-asdesc-insection" href="#crafting"></a>.


**Bonus Die:** If you are performing an existing work of art, such as a
musical composition or a play, you can include the work's Tag Die as a
Bonus Die.

**Opposition:** Under most situations, an Arts roll will automatically
succeed and the success points will determine the quality of the
performance. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard Opposition of
Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point                         |
| ++++++:       | Encore, Encore\!                           |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Successful Performance:** You give a successful performance of a work,
be it already prepared or an improvisational performance. You can create
a one-word tag with a +1D0 Tag Die. This Tag Die lasts until the end of
the scene, and can be used with other Specialties as a Bonus Die when
appropriate. You can make one additional Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for
each success point you spend.

**Increase Tag Die: **One Tag Die of your performance improves by one
die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks you have in
Culture (Arts), as shown on the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Arts Rank | Bonus Die |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| 1         | \+1D0     |
| 2         | \+1D6     |
| 3         | \+1D8     |
| 4         | \+1D10    |
| 5         | \+1D12    |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Encore, Encore\!:** You give such a successful performance that no one
in the audience will ever forget it, or you. Any Tag Dice from this
performance last for 24 hours and are automatically maximized.

#### Etiquette

*Affinity Specialty*

The Etiquette specialty encompasses general knowledge about the customs,
politics, traditions, and manners of the cultures of Elara and Ifran,
including the use of proper etiquette while in a noble court.

**Foreign Etiquette:** When dealing with people from other countries or
cultures, you get a Drop 2 penalty on Etiquette rolls. If you do not
share a common language, the penalty increases to a Drop 4 penalty.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a member of the royal court, read a
heraldic coat of arms, remember the correct form of address for a noble
title, recall court gossip about a baroness, cite the local laws and
customs.

**Opposition:** Under most situations, an Etiquette roll will
automatically succeed and the success points will determine the quality
of one's behavior. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard
Opposition of Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.

**Bonus Die:** Add your own highest Social Rank Die as a Bonus Die when
making an Etiquette roll.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

| ++++:         | Pass as Different Social Rank              |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Avoid Faux Pas:** You communicate what you are trying to say without
making any social blunders.

**Impress an Audience:** You make a favorable impression on those who
observe you who have a social rank of Commoner (D0). You also gain a
+1D0 Tag Die that can be used in Interaction and Culture (Etiquette)
rolls as a Bonus Die until the end of the scene. For each additional
success point you spent, the social rank you impress increases by one.

**Improve Impression:** You increase the Tag Die by one step for every
two success points you spend. The size of the Tag Die limited by your
Etiquette specialty ranks as follows:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Etiquette Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| \+1             | \+1D0           |
| \+2             | \+1D6           |

| \+5             | \+1D12          |

bonus if you commit a social faux pas or otherwise fail to act in
accordance with the airs you've put on.

#### Scholarship

*Guile Specialty*

In Gallinea, a well-rounded education is the mark of a civilized woman
or man. The Scholarship specialty represents your breadth of book
learning and ability to do research when necessary. As such, it is used
very often for knowledge rolls and rarely for anything else.

**Language:** For every rank you have in Scholarship, you gain an
additional language prowess of your choice.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall basic historical knowledge, identify a
spoken or written language, remember a piece of trivia, name some of the
most prestigious universities and their professors, understand and
disagree with an obscure theological argument.

**Crafting:** Write research reports, translations, or non-fiction
books<a class="xref-asdesc-insection" href="#crafting"></a>.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on your Scholarship to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Culture (Scholarship), as shown on the following
table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

place, thing, group, or event for each Success Point you spend. You can
only learn things that someone has written down in a book.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Teach a Lesson:** If you spend at least an hour teaching someone, she
can temporarily gain Competency in one Skill or language in which you
have Competency. This Competency lasts for 24 hours after your

teach another student at the same time. A student can only learn one
such temporary Competency at any time, from any teacher.


### Defense ## {.breakbefore}

The Defense skill is used in combat to avoid taking damage. Whenever you
are attacked, you can choose which of the appropriate Defense
specialties you will use, although depending on the type of attack, your
Defense choices may be limited by the type of attack. For example, you
can't really Parry a bullet.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Defense skill.

**Wounds:** Defense rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

#### Parry

*Verve Specialty*

A Parry is an attempt to block an attack with a weapon or a buckler; you
need to be wielding something in one of your hands in order to make a
Parry.

The primary advantage of a Parry is that if you successfully Parry, you
can also execute a Riposte – if you've got enough Success Points to do
so. You can only execute one Riposte per Parry.

**Wounds:** Parry rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Possibility of Weapon Breakage:** If you use Parry to defend against a
Lunge attack and are unsuccessful, one possible result for the attacker
is to break your weapon.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Bucklers and extra shields<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** A Parry can be used against an attacker's Lunge, Feint,
or Brawl roll, but not against a Riposte or Aim attack.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you don't do this,
the attack still takes effect on you, with the attacker spending her
Success Points normally.

**Execute a Riposte:** You can make a Riposte attack. This is the only
way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful Parry or
Feint.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to
attack you. (This can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.)
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

#### Block

*Affinity Specialty*

A Block roll is an attempt to prevent injury to yourself by using armor,
a shield, nearby furniture, terrain, or even a less vulnerable part of
your own body.

**Wounds:** Block rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a suit of armor or a
shield, remember the names of famous soldiers, identify the blacksmith's
maker's mark on armor.

**Crafting:** Rigid armor<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** A Block roll can be used to defend against an attacker's
Lunge, Riposte, or Aim roll, but not against a Feint or Brawl attack.

### Initiative ## {.breakbefore} 

The Initiative skill is used in combat to determine who goes first, as
well as to take additional actions during a fight. The order of

each combatant enters the fight. 

Generally, a character only needs to have ranks in one Initiative
specialty, usually corresponding to her highest Attribute Die.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Initiative skill.

#### Impulse

*Verve Specialty*

The Impulse specialty is favored by combatants who have high Verve, and

used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined action

Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. You can Interpose only once per round.

attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. You can Reprise
Attack only once per round.

**Opposition:** Initiative rolls are automatically successful, and
ranked in order by the MJ from highest (first to act) to lowest (last to

The Inspire specialty covers all attempts to instill a particular
feeling in another person (or group of people) – such as to make her
angry, enthusiastic, happy, frightened, or sad.

Inspire isn't a kind of mind control; someone won't take an action that
they are opposed to doing. But you can provoke her to give some kind of
reaction to your words.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall an inspiring speech from history or fiction,
remember the names of great leaders.

success. If you have a language barrier or other Drop Penalty applied,
the difficulty increases to Easy (3D6) or higher.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inspiring Speech:** Your words start to sway those who hear them. You
can create a tag based on an emotional state, with a +1D0 Tag Die. This
Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and can be used with other
Specialties as a Bonus Die when appropriate. You can make one additional
Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for each success point you spend.

**Increase Tag Die: **One Tag Die created by your inspiring speech
improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks
you have in Interaction (Inspire), as shown on the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Inspire Rank | Bonus Die |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 1            | \+1D0     |
| 2            | \+1D6     |
| 3            | \+1D8     |
| 4            | \+1D10    |
| 5            | \+1D12    |

**Reduce an Ally's Yield:** If an ally who can hear you has taken Yield,
you can reduce it by spending two Success Points per point of Yield.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** One opponent who can hear you takes one Yield for
every two Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or
exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Instill Emotion:** Choose one of the Tags you have active in this
scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends for you. One person who
can hear you gains either a Drop Penalty or a Bonus Die on all actions
related to that Tag, your choice. For each additional success point you
spend, you can affect another person. The Drop Penalty decreases after
each time it's applied, and the Bonus Die decreases in size after each
use.

Table: Inspire Results

| Tag Die | Drop Penalty | Bonus Die |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| \+1D0   | Drop 1       | \+1D6     |
| \+1D6   | Drop 2       | \+1D8     |
| \+1D8   | Drop 3       | \+1D10    |
| \+1D10  | Drop 4       | \+1D12    |
| \+1D12  | Drop 4       | \+1D12    |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Provoke Reaction:** You cause someone who can hear you to react to
your words, even if she doesn't really want to. Choose one of the Tags
you have active in this scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends
for you. The person you've affected will react on her next turn based on
that Tag. You don't get to choose the specific reaction, and it's
instead based on how she would normally react to such feelings. For
example, if you use a Tag Die of Anger, her response might be to attack
you, to fire a scathing insult at you, to burst into tears, to order
someone else to attack you, to leave the area, or to mock your clothing
choices.

#### Negotiate

*Affinity Specialty*

Negotiate covers diplomatic attempts to persuade someone, to compromise,
or give something up in return for something else. In general, to use
Negotiate you must be offering a bargaining chip of some kind, although
it need not be a completely fair trade. 

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** A Negotiate roll for something simple, like haggling over
goods, takes one minute. More complicated business deals or diplomacy
take an hour or more.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the price of an object, recall details on
treaties, remember something the other party might have overlooked.

**Crafting:** Contracts, treaties, and other legal documents<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Negotiate rolls are always opposed by the other party's
Negotiate rolls. If there isn't a party in opposition to you, you
probably aren't in a negotiation.

:::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::
| Negotiate      |                       |
| :------------- | :-------------------- |
| Time:          | 1 minute or 1 hour    |
| Opposition:    | Negotiate             |

| \++:           | Put it in Writing     |
| ++:            | Reach Compromise      |
| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point    |
| \+++:          | Close the Deal        |
| \++++:         | Gain the Upper Hand   |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Float a Proposal:** You propose a course of action, and create a +1D0
Tag Die based on that proposal. Until the end of the scene, you can use
that Tag Die as a Bonus Die on appropriate rolls, including further
Negotiate rolls -- or Wealth rolls if you are haggling over a purchase.
If you create a new proposal, the old Tag Die ends.

**Refine the Offer:** For every two success points you spend, the Tag
Die of your existing proposal increases by one die size.

**Counter-Offer:** If the other party has a Tag Die, you can decrease
her die size by one step, or remove her Tag Die entirely if she has a
+1D6 Bonus Die. 

**Put It In Writing:** You get the other party to agree to sign a
written document after you close the deal.

**Reach Compromise:** You and the other party come to a compromise that
benefits you both equally, more or less, and you close the deal. All Tag
Dice created by either party immediately end.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Close the Deal:** You end the negotiation. Whatever you and the other
party have agreed upon is how it the terms will remain, and the other
party won't renegotiate terms in this scene. If you are haggling over a
purchase, you can use the Tag Die of your proposal as a Bonus Die on
your wealth roll; if the other party has a Tag Die, she can add that to
the opposition roll.

**Gain the Upper Hand:** You end the negotiation. You get what you were
hoping to gain without major concessions. The other party loses Tag Dice
she may have created during the negotiation.

#### Deceive

*Guile Specialty*

Deceive is the ability to tell a believable lie, avoiding telltale
quirks and pitfalls that might reveal your duplicity. Lies which are
obviously untrue and unbelievable impose a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4,
at the MJ's discretion.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** Deception rolls are made after each new, major claim is made,
so could occur after 30 seconds of rambling, or hours of prolonged
storytelling.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty is not often used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Crafting:** An alternate identity or a simple disguise<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Use the Intuition specialty of each person who is
listening to the lies.

::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::
| Deceive     |                    |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| Time:       | Free Roll          |
| Opposition: | Intuition          |
| +:          | Think on Your Feet |
| ++:         | Appear Sincere     |
| +++:        | Gain 1 Style Point |
| ++++:       | Appear Trustworthy |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Think on Your Feet:** You come up with something quickly so that you
don't look like you're obviously making something up. You can create a
+1D0 Tag Die based on your lie that you can use as a Bonus Die on
appropriate rolls until the end of the scene. Attempts by others to
disprove your lie, through logical deduction or knowledge rolls, are
made against Easy (3D6) standard opposition.

**Appear Sincere:** You lie while giving the impression that you really
do believe what you're saying. For every two success points you spend,
the Tag Die of your lie increases by one die size and the difficulty of
disproving the lie increases by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Appear Trustworthy:** Even if your lie is later exposed as false,
those who heard it still believe you that you didn't intend to deceive
them. Maybe you were mistaken, or they misheard you, or you misspoke.


### Magicks ## {.breakbefore}

The world of Elara has very subtle forms of magick: brewing draughts,
weaving charms into clothing, and reading portents. Most characters
completely lack knowledge in Magicks, leaving the study up to those who
specialize in it.

Successfully using a Magicks specialty results in the creation of a
Charm die. As with other types of dice, you can have only one Charm die
in any dice pool.

#### Weave

*Verve Specialty*

Charmwoven clothing must be specifically created for each character
using the Weave specialty, as it involves knowledge of the wearer's
birthstone and other personal qualities.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate charmwoven items and identify their
charms, determine the specific master charmweaver who created an item of
apparel, recall facts related to the creation of cloth and silk.

**Crafting: **Articles of clothing, including charmwoven apparel<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Most Weave rolls are made to craft garments. Sensing or
restoring a charm is Easy (3D6) standard opposition. An attempt to
suppress a or bolster a Charm Die is made against standard opposition
corresponding to the size of the Charm Die -- Easy (3D6) for a +1D6
Charm Die, Moderate (3D8) for a +1D8 Charm Die, and so on.

:::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::

| \+++:          | Bolster Charm Die             |
| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point            |
| \++++:         | Restore Charm Die             |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Sense Charm: **You can sense charms woven into clothing that are in
the same area as you, starting with the nearest charm to you. You learn
the article of clothing that's encharmed and which Specialty the Charm
Die applies to. If you spend another success point, you also learn the
size of the Charm Die. For each additional success point you spend, you
can sense another charm in your area or an adjacent area. You can choose
to skip over any charm created or worn by you.

**Suppress Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is reduced by one
step. If it has a +1D6 Charm Die, you can remove it entirely. This
effect lasts until the end of the current scene. Each additional 2
success points you spend reduces the Charm Die by one step. You can
reduce a Charm Die as many steps as you have ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Bolster Charm Die:** You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is increased by
one step until the end of the scene. You can only increase a Charm Die
by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Restore Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die that has been
suppressed or temporarily removed, you can restore the Charm Die to its
normal value. Until the end of the scene, that article's Charm Die can't
be suppressed.

#### Brew

*Affinity Specialty*

Brew is the magickal ability to distill enchantments into drinkable
draughts.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a draught and its effects, recall the
names of the master alchemists in a city, describe where exotic
ingredients can be found.

**Crafting: **Salves, draughts, and other alchemical formulations<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Most Magicks (Brew) rolls are made to create a draught
or salve. Mixing a concoction has a standard difficulty of Easy (3D6). 

:::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Brew           |                                |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- |

| Opposition:    | Standard Opposition            |
| Item Die:      | Alchemy tools or laboratory    |
| +:             | Mix a Concoction               |
| \++:           | Apply a Concoction             |
| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point             |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Mix a Concoction:** You hastily mix together volatile chemicals and
reagents to produce an immediate reaction. You spend 1 unit of
alchemical ingredients and create one of the concoctions listed in
<a href="#concoctions" class="in-chapter-under"></a>. The concoction has an initial potency
level of 1 but increases by 1 for every 2 success points you spend. The
concoction lasts until your next turn, after which it becomes inert.

**Apply a Concoction:** You apply the effects of your concoction to
yourself, your area, an adjacent area, or another person in the same
area as you. Each recipient of the effect beyond the first requires that
you spend 1 additional unit of alchemical ingredients, with a limit of
additional targets equal to your specialty ranks in Magicks (Brew).

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

#### Portents

*Guile Specialty*

The Portents specialty involves reading omens and signs as well as using
cards, dice, tea leaves, or astrological charts to determine someone's
future. It also includes placing hexes on people, and creating simple
trinkets known as bibelots that ward off hexes and bad luck.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall the names of famous seers or witches
throughout history, identify when someone is the target of a hex,
identify a bibelot's charm, remember the astrological signs and
birthstones.

**Crafting: **Astrological charts, bibelots, and divination tools<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** If you read either the general omens around you or a
willing subject, the roll is an automatic success and the success points
determine the strength of the reading. If you are doing a reading on an
unwilling subject or if you are casting a hex on someone, the difficulty
is either Easy (3D6) or an opposed Magicks (Portents) roll, whichever is
better for the subject.

:::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Portents       |                                        |

| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point                     |
| ++++:          | Cast a Hex                             |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Read Portents:** You make a general prediction about the next 24
hours. Ask one yes-or-no question, or have the person you're reading ask
a yes-or-no question. You receive an answer which creates a +1D0 Tag Die
connected to that answer. Until the prediction comes true or 24 hours
passes, the subject of the reading can choose to use the tag as a Bonus
Die on any rolls that relate to the answer proving true. Each use of the
Tag Die decreases its size by one die size, or ends the prediction if
it's a +1D0 Bonus Die. As long as any prediction is still in effect, the
subject can't be the recipient of another reading.

**Increase Accuracy:** The Tag Die increases by one die size, with a
limit set by your ranks in Magicks (Portents) as shown in the following
table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Portents Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| \+1            | \+1D0           |
| \+2            | \+1D6           |
| \+3            | \+1D8           |
| \+4            | \+1D10          |
| \+5            | \+1D12          |

**Increase Precision:** The duration of your prediction increases by 24
hours, up to a limit of increases equal to your Magicks (Portents)
ranks.

**Increase Specificity:** The subject of the reading can ask another
yes-or-no question and receive an answer, or ask a question that can be
answered with a single noun. This creates an additional +1D0 Tag Die
based on the new question, that otherwise functions like the first Tag
Die. The maximum number of additional questions is limited to the number
of Magicks (Portents) specialty ranks you have.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Cast a Hex:** You choose one skill and the subject of your reading
becomes cursed on rolls with that skill for the next 24 hours. If your
subject is wearing a bibelot for that skill, the hex immediately ends
and the bibelot is destroyed. Otherwise, any existing hexes on her end
and she gains a Drop 1 penalty on that skill and its specialties. Every
time the Drop penalty is applied to one of her rolls, it decreases by 1.
When the Drop penalty is reduced to 0, the hex ends. For every two
success points you spend, you can increase the initial size of the Drop
penalty by 1, with a limit determined by your ranks in Portents as shown
on the following table:

Table: Maximum Hex Penalty

| Portents Ranks | Maximum Hex Penalty |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| \+1            | Drop 1              |
| \+2            | Drop 2              |
| \+3            | Drop 3              |
| \+4            | Drop 4              |
| \+5            | Drop 4              |


### Medicine ## {.breakbefore}

Medical science is relatively advanced in Elara, thanks to both a long
history of witch-midwives and alchemy, and recent advances in science.
The Medicine skill is used to treat minor injuries, perform major
surgery, and work safely with poisonous toxins.

#### Surgery

*Verve Specialty*

Surgery is a Specialty which can be used to heal injuries which are
resistant to the Treat specialty, as well as to perform other surgical
procedures.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Perform an autopsy to determine the cause of death,
recall the names of famous surgeons, diagnose a patient in need of
surgery.

**Wounds:** Apply the patient's wounds as a Drop Penalty on your surgery
roll.

**Supplies:** The Surgery specialty uses medicine.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on a surgical procedure to add
a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

**Extra Supplies: **You can use extra medicine during surgery to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Supplies

| Units of medicine | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |

**Opposition:** Healing wounds or minor surgeries are Easy (3D6)
standard difficulty. Major surgeries are Moderate (3D8) or higher.

| +++++:         | Major Surgical Procedure                 |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Patient Survives:** Despite the relatively advanced state of Elaran
medicine, surgery remains a risky proposition. If you don't spend one
Success Point to ensure the life of the patient, the patient takes one
Wound.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound. This requires that you
spend 1 unit of medicine per wound healed.

**Minor Surgical Procedure:** You perform a minor surgical procedure,
such as suturing a wound or the setting of a bone. The patient must rest
for 1 day or else gain one Wound the first time she engages in physical
activity. A minor procedure expends 2 units of medicine.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Major Surgical Procedure:** You perform a major surgical procedure,
such as a Caesarian section, gender confirmation surgery, or removal of
the appendix. The patient must rest for 1 week (six days) or else gain
one Wound the first time each day that she engages in physical activity.
A major procedure expends 5 units of medicine.

#### Treat

*Affinity Specialty*

The Treat specialty is used to care for those who are injured or sick.
After a Wound is taken, only one Treat roll can be made; further Wounds
must be healed using the Surgery specialty.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Diagnose a patient as suffering from poison or
disease, determine the cause of an injury, recall facts about a known
illness and useful folk cures for the same.

**Crafting:** Cures for diseases and other medical supplies<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Base Time:** Treating a wound or removing Yield takes one minute, and
treating diseases or applying cures takes one hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on treatment to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Treat Rank Required |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                 |

**Extra Supplies: **You can use extra medicine during treatment to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Supplies

| Units of medicine | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2                 | 1D0       | \+1                     |

| 8                 | 1D12      | \+5                     |

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to treat a patient by taking a Drop
penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking extra
time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
treatment, as shown on the following tables:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

Table: Rushing a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 30 minutes      | Drop 1       |
| 15 minutes      | Drop 2       |
| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** The opposition depends on the severity of the condition
being treated. Reducing Yield is an automatic success, with the number
of success points determining how many points of Yield are removed.
Treating wounds is Easy (3D6), and treating a disease is dependent upon
the severity of the disease.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Reduce Patient's Yield:** If someone in the same area as you has taken
Yield, you can remove one point of Yield per success point you spend.
This expends one unit of medicine, regardless of how many success points
you spend.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Reduce Disease Severity:** The severity of the disease decreases by
one step, or is eliminated if the disease is already of the weakest
severity. This consumes one unit of medicine for each severity level
decreased. 

#### Poison

*Guile Specialty*

The Poison specialty covers the creation, application, and use of
various toxic substances as well as antidotes for the same. A target can
be poisoned directly, or poison can be applied to a weapon.

**Standard Poisons:** The following types poisons are commonly used
throughout Elara and Ifran: deadly poison, impairing poison, and sleep
poison. See <a href="#poison" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a> for more details.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a poison without being exposed to it,
diagnose someone suffering from poison based on the effects, determine
whether or not an item of food is safe to consume.

**Crafting:** Poisons and antidotes<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Applying poison to your own weapon is an automatic
success, with the number of success points determining how many times
you can use that application of poison. Directly administering poison to
your victim is opposed by her Brawl roll. Adding poison to food or drink
is opposed by the highest Observation of whoever might be able to spot
you doing the deed. Administering an antidote is based on the potency of
the poison.

:::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point                        |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Poisoned Weapon:** You can add expend one dose of poison and apply it
to a Knife, Sword, Polearm, or the arrows for a Bow. For each success
point you spend, you can use the poison's success table on one attack,
in addition to the normal success table for your weapon and attack. Your
weapon ceases to be poisoned when you make a number of attacks equal to
the success points you spent, when you apply a different poison to the
weapon, or at the end of the current scene.

**Poison Your Victim:** You can use your Success Points to directly
injure or debilitate the target by expending one dose of poison. Each
additional success point you spend can be used on the poison's success
table against your victim.

**Administer Antidote:** You administer an antidote to someone who has
been poisoned, expending one dose of antidote. For every two success
points you spend, you can reduce the potency of the poison, reduce the
duration of the poison, remove 2 Yield inflicted by the poison, or heal
1 Wound inflicted by poison during the current scene.

**Avoid Notice:** You apply your poison surreptitiously, hoping to go
unseen. The opposition for an Observation roll to spot the poison --
either on your blade, in a drink, or in food -- is Easy (3D6). For every
two additional success points, you can increase the difficulty to spot
the posion by one step, limited by your specialty ranks in Medicine
(Poison) as shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Poison Rank | Item Die              |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1           | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2           | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3           | Difficult (3D10)      |
| 4           | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| 5           | Very Difficult (3D12) |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.


### Military ## {.breakbefore}

The Military skill includes training in ranged combat and unarmed
combat, plus strategic planning. A character with Competency in the
Military skill may have served in as a formal member of the military,
but it's not automatic.

#### Brawl

*Verve Specialty*

The Brawl specialty can be used to attack in unarmed combat, and also
defend against the same. You usually need at least one hand free to make
a Brawl attack.

**Wounds:** Brawl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Holds:** A held combatant receives a Drop Penalty on her Dueling,
Parry, and Aim rolls, and cannot Dodge, Run, or Move. The penalty starts
at Drop 1 when a hold is first achieved, and increases by 1 every time
the hold is increased (see below).

**Crafting:** Quarterstaves, clubs, and other bludgeons<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate someone's unarmed fighting technique after
watching her brawl, recall the names of famous pugilists.

Point you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Negate Brawl Attack:** You prevent a Brawl attack from doing any
damage to you, and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you
don't do this, the attack still takes effect on you, with the attacker
spending her Success Points normally.

**Achieve or Break Hold:** You achieve a hold on your target, or if you
are already held, you can break that hold. You can choose to do both in
one roll, if you have enough Success Points. A combatant who is held
suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two
additional Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty
by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in
an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result
in her falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. A prone
character suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and
cannot Move or Run until she stands up; standing up is a Drop 1 combined
action.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is wielding.
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

#### Aim

*Affinity Specialty*

The Aim specialty covers all kinds of ranged combat, from firing muskets
and bows to throwing daggers. Only Block or Dodge can be used to defend
against an Aim attack, and not Parry.

Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

**Free Reload:** You can reload your weapon if the reload time is Drop 4
or lower

**Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone. A prone character suffers a
Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and cannot Move or Run until
she stands up. Standing up is a Drop 1 combined action.

#### Strategy

*Guile Specialty*

Strategy is the ability to make battle plans, both before and during a
fight. Characters with the Strategy specialty are skilled at leading
during combat and reading the way a fight is going.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify the leader of an army, evaluate a battle
plan to discover weaknesses, organize a supply line, recall the names of
famous generals.

**Crafting:** Battle plans, tactical maps, and military orders<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition: **Use the Military (Strategy) roll of your enemy's leader.
If there's no leader, your roll is an automatic success and the success
points you spend are used to determine the effectiveness of your
tactics.

| +++++:       | Give an Order               |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


**Read the Fight:** For each Success Point you spend to Read the Fight,
choose one other combatant in the fight. You learn her Competency Die,
current Yield, and Wounds taken. Each additional success point allows
you to get information about an additional combatant.

**Increase Tactical Advantage:** For every two success points you spend,
you can do one of the following: reduce an ally's Yield by 1, increase
your advantage, increase an ally's advantage, or increase an ally's
initiative points by 1.

and give her an order that consists of one action. If she chooses to
obey the order, she gains a +1D0 Bonus Die for that action, and can
immediately take the ordered action (such as an attack, a move, or
reloading her weapon), even though it's not her turn. For every 2
additional success points you spend, the Bonus Die increases by one
step, with a limit determined by your ranks in Military (Strategy):

Table: Maximum Bonus Die

| \+5            | \+1D12            |


### Nature ## {.breakbefore}

Knowledge of the natural world is expressed through Competency in the
Nature skill. Nature is a hands-on skill, learned through experience
rather than book learning.

#### Explore

*Verve Specialty*

The Explore specialty lets you navigate through the world, on land, sea,
or even in the air. When appropriate, you can also use Explore to search
for survival needs such as water, food, and shelter. A map of the area,
a compass, or a navigator's astrolabe can provide an Item Die bonus on
the roll.

**Base Time:** Determining directions or finding a shortcut takes one
minute, and other uses of Nature (Explore) take 1 hour.

**Opposition:** Under normal circumstances, a Nature (Explore) roll is
an automatic success, and the success points determine how well you've
done at your task. Inclement weather or hostile climates have a standard
difficulty of Easy (3D6) or higher.

**Determine Directions:** You know which direction is north, and roughly
which direction you must travel in order to reach your desired
destination.

**Locate a Landmark:** You find a notable and unique feature such as a
geological formation, ruins of a town, or a burnt tree. This helps to
orient you so that you avoid becoming lost. You create a +1D0 Tag Die
based on the name of this location, which you can use on rolls to avoid
becoming lost. The size of the Tag Die decreases by one step for every
two leagues you travel away from the landmark. For every additional 2
success points you spend the initial Tag Die increases by one step,
limited by your specialty ranks in Nature (Explore) as shown on the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Explore Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| \+1           | \+1D0           |

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Find Shelter:** You find a safe place to camp for the night that is

additional success point you spend, you can increase the duration by 6
hours.

**Discover Shortcut:** You discover a way to reach your destination 5%
sooner than you expected, often allowing you to intercept another person
or group before they arrive. For each additional success point you
spend, you decrease your travel time by 5%, up to a limit of one success
point per specialty rank of Explore.

#### Husbandry

*Affinity Specialty*

Animal handling and crop farming is covered by the Husbandry specialty,
along with dealing with animals of all types, including domesticated
animals such as cows, dogs, horses, or cats. This skill can also be used
with wild animals and naturally occurring plants.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a mount, livestock animal,
or edible plant, predict the weather over the next couple of days,
recall the names of local landowners, identify the properties of an
unknown plant or animal.

**Crafting:** Leather goods, flexible armor, and cooked meals<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Wounds:** If you are treating a wounded animal, you have Drop Penalty
based on the animal's wounds.

**Time:** Controlling an animal or riding a horse takes 1 action, and
other uses of Husbandry take 1 hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on farming chores to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Nature (Husbandry), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Husbandry Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |

| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

**Item Die:** You can add the Weapon Die of a Knife when butchering, the
Item Die of a domesticated animal when gathering crops, tending flocks,
or farming, and the Item Die of chirurgeon's tools when doing veterinary
medicine. For handling a domesticated animal, add the animal's Training
attribute as an Item Die.

**Opposition:** For gathering crops, farming, or butchery, the roll is
an automatic success and your success points are used to determine how
well you perform the task. Handling one of your own domesticated animals
is an automatic success as well.

The standard opposition for using handle animal with a wild animal or an
unfriendly domesticated animal is based the higher of its Instinct or
Ferocity attributes. Handling an animal with D6 Instinct is Easy (3D6),
one with D8 Ferocity is Moderate (3D8), and so on.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Handle Animal:** You can make a domesticated animal perform one of its
tricks, go where you want it to go, or otherwise follow your directions.
With a wild animal, you can either make it flee or convince it to not
attack you and your companions until the end of the scene as long as you
don't approach it. If you're riding a horse, each Success Point you
spend allows you to clear one obstacle such as a fence, hedge, or
stream.

When you successfully use Handle Animal, you create a +1D0 one-word Tag
Die for the animal's attitude toward you that can be used as a Bonus Die
in Nature or Defense checks against that animal. The Tag Die lasts until
the end of the scene, and increases by one step for every 2 success
points you spend, up to a maximum based on your ranks in Husbandry as
shown in the following table:

Table: (table) Maximum Tag Die

| Husbandry Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |

| \+5             | \+1D12          |

**Gather Crops:** Assuming you have access to a field of crops, you can
harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each additional success point you
spend, you can harvest an additional 2 units of foodstuffs.

**Dairy Farming:** Assuming you have access to milk cows, chickens, and
other farm animals, you can harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each
additional success point you spend, you can harvest an additional 2
units of foodstuffs.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Veterinary Medicine:** You can heal one Wound that has been inflicted
on an animal in the current scene, or you can decrease the severity of a
disease affecting an animal. Each Wound treated or disease severity
reduced requires that you spend one dose of medicine.

**Butchery:** You slaughter and butcher an animal to create foodstuffs.
An animal can provide a number of foodstuffs equal to its yield limit.
Farm animals provide an additional 50% more foodstuffs.

**Teach a New Trick:** You can teach a new trick to a domesticated
animal. If the animal already knows as many tricks as you have Specialty
ranks of Husbandry, or is an old dog, you can't teach it any new tricks.
For a wild animal, domesticating it counts as one of its tricks.

#### Prowl

*Guile Specialty*

The Prowl specialty represents stealthy, secretive movement or action,
usually taken outdoors where there is sufficient cover or shadows to
hide from observers.

You make a Prowl roll as an action when you are not hidden and attempt
to do so, or as a free roll if you are already out of sight and someone
is looking for you. If you move from your location without moving
undetected, you must make another Prowl roll.

**Wounds:** Prowl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember old abandoned bandit hideouts, recall the
names of famous brigands.

**Opposition:** Hiding under optimal conditions (night, no moon,
inclement weather) is normally an automatic success. Such situations are
rare, however. Instead, most Prowl rolls are Easy (3D6) under ordinary
circumstances. Increase the standard difficulty by one step for each of
the following conditions: tracked by animals, bright sunlight, lack of
cover, quiet location.

::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::
| Prowl       |                     |
| :---------- | :------------------ |
| Time:       | 1 action            |
| Opposition: | Standard Opposition |
| +:          | Hide                |
| +:          | Lead the Ambush     |
| ++:         | Increase Advantage  |
| +++:        | Gain 1 Style Point  |
| ++++:       | Move Undetected     |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Hide:** You find a place to hide until the end of the scene or you
move to a different location, whichever comes first. In order to see
you, someone else must make an Observation roll against a standard
difficulty of Easy (3D6). For every two additional success points you
spend, you increase the difficulty by one step, limited by your ranks in
Nature (Prowl):

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Prowl Rank | Item Die              |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2          | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3          | Difficult (3D10)      |
| 4          | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| 5          | Very Difficult (3D12) |

**Lead the Ambush:** You can extend the effects of your Prowl roll to
one additional ally in the same Area as you for each Success Point you
spend on Lead the Ambush. This can include hiding, increasing advantage,
or moving undetected.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Move Undetected:** You can take a free move to an adjacent Area and
remain unseen if you are already hidden.


###  Observation ## {.breakbefore}

The Observation skill encompasses both reading situations and reading
people, as well as putting together disparate clues to see the bigger
picture.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Observation skill.

#### Perceive

*Verve Specialty*

With a Perceive roll, you can spot a person in a crowd, listen for one
voice in a chorus, notice the smell of burning wood, or detect an ambush
before it happens. The MJ can call for Perceive as a free roll, or you
can make additional rolls by using your action to examine your
surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Accurately describe someone you have seen or heard,
or identify her from a description.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Perceive roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for spotting someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll. Trying to Perceive something under difficult
circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded tavern, can have a
difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
| Perceive      |                        |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition    |
| +:            | Notice the Obvious     |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point     |
| ++++:         | Notice Minor Detail    |
| +++++:        | Notice Hidden Detail   |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Notice the Obvious:** You notice something which is pretty easy to
spot but not directly in front of you, or you spot someone who is hiding
from you. For each additional success point, you spot something else
that isn't directly in front of you or hiding.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Notice Minor Detail:** You notice a small detail about a person, an
animal, an object, a vehicle, or an area that most people wouldn't
catch. For every 2 additional success points, you notice another detail
about the same thing.

**Notice Hidden Detail:** You make note of a tiny detail that someone
has taken pains to hide, disguise, or eliminate.

#### Intuition

*Affinity Specialty*

Intuition involves reading subtle cues from your environment, including
non-verbal cues from other people. The MJ can call for Intuition as a
free roll, or you can make additional rolls by using your action to
examine your surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember something that you didn't consciously
notice at the time you saw it, recall someone that you met in your
childhood.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, an Intuition roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for sensing someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to intuit something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
| Intuition     |                        |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition    |
| +:            | Get a Hunch            |
| ++:           | Sense Danger           |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point     |
| ++++:         | Sense Falsehood        |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Get a Hunch:** You have a gut feeling about something, and it's
probably right. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that can be used as a Bonus
Die on any Observation or Initiative rolls until the end of the scene.
The Tag Die is based on one word picked by the MJ. For each additional
success point, the MJ adds another word to the Tag. For every 2
additional success points, you increase the Tag Die by one step, with a
limit based on your ranks in Observation (Intuition) as shown by the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Intuition Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| \+1             | \+1D0           |
| \+2             | \+1D6           |
| \+3             | \+1D8           |
| \+4             | \+1D10          |
| \+5             | \+1D12          |

**Sense Danger:** You can identify one or more sources of immediate
danger that aren't readily apparent, including an ambush. Every two
Success Points you spend spots another potential source of harm.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sense Falsehood:** You can tell when someone is lying to you, picking
up on her unconscious tells. You don't know what the truth is, but you
do know you're not hearing it now. For the rest of the scene, you know
when she's telling you the truth and when she's not.

#### Deduce

*Guile Specialty*

The Deduce specialty lets you size up a situation and formulate a
scenario in which they make sense, as provided by the MJ. This will
always be a supplement to your own roleplaying and decision-making
processes while playing *The Queen's Cavaliers*; it is not meant to
substitute for player ingenuity. Deduce can also be used to analyze
clues and spot falsehoods.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember the solution to a puzzle you've solved
before, decipher a coded message, recall the names of famous detectives.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Deduce roll is an automatic
success and the number of success points determines how well you
accomplished the task. The standard opposition for detecting someone or
something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to Deduce something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::
| Deduce        |                          |
| :------------ | :----------------------- |
| Time:         | Free Roll, or 1 action   |
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition      |
| +:            | Recognize Clue           |
| ++:           | Reach Simple Conclusion  |
| +++:          | Gain 1 Style Point       |
| ++++:         | Infer Greater Plan       |
| +++++:        | Reach Complex Conclusion |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Recognize Clue:** You realize that something in your current situation
is out of place or doesn't add up. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that you
can use on Observation and Streetwise rolls until the end of the current
scene. The MJ will tell you what the Tag is, but won't tell you what it
means. For 2 additional points you can increase the Tag Die by one step,
to a limit based on your ranks in Observation (Deduce) as shown on the
following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Deduce Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| \+1          | \+1D0           |
| \+2          | \+1D6           |
| \+3          | \+1D8           |
| \+4          | \+1D10          |
| \+5          | \+1D12          |

**Reach Simple Conclusion:** You draw a basic conclusion from the
available facts. You need to have recognized at least one clue to reach
a conclusion. The conclusion will be simple and straightforward, a la
Ockham's razor, but is not guaranteed to be correct. Each time you find
another clue, you automatically know whether it fits your simple
conclusion or not.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Infer Greater Plan:** You can determine whether or not something was
deliberately done, and if so, become aware that there is more to the
situation than what appears. If you witness more of this plan in action,
you will automatically know that it's part of the same scheme, even if
you don't yet know the role it plays.

**Reach Complex Conclusion:** You draw together several clues to form a
more complex scenario that fits the facts as you understand them. The
complex conclusion is guaranteed to be more accurate than a simple
conclusion, but it may not include all the variables and thus may be
subject to misunderstanding or inaccuracies. Each time you find another
clue or witness more of a plan, you automatically know how to include it
in your complex conclusion.


### Science ## {.breakbefore}

Science is a skill that covers the use, repair, and creation of advanced
technology and complex mathematics, from time watches to airships, from
repeating cannons to wing-gliders. The Blackpowder specialty also covers
the use of explosives.

#### Blackpowder

*Verve Specialty*

The Blackpowder specialty is used to work with explosives of all types,
as well as the rare phlogistone material that allows airships to soar
through the sky. Skilled powderworkers are employed by militaries, by
craftsmen, and by airship crews.

A Blackpowder roll is used to fire cannons and throw grenades, which
cause explosive damage to all within a given Area or to structures such
as buildings or ships. Although pistols and muskets use blackpowder to
fire their ammunition, the Military (Aim) skill is used for those
hand-held weapons.

**Explosion Damage:** An explosion weapon does damage to everything
inside a given Area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent
Areas, and even targets up to two Areas away for the most powerful
explosions.

The person who initiated the explosion makes a Blackpowder roll as an
automatic success to set the base damage and the range.

Anyone in an area affected by the explosion makes a Block or Dodge roll
that also is an automatic success. For one success point on the Block or
Dodge roll, a target gains one less point of Yield, and for three
successes she takes one less Wound.

:::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Block or Dodge | (Explosion)                             |

| +++:           | Take 1 Less Wound                       |
| +++:           | Gain 1 Style Point                      |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a cannon or grenade,
describe the process used to create blackpowder or phlogistone,
remember, remember the 5th of Frimaire.

**Crafting:** Phlogistone furnaces, cannons, grenades, fireworks, and
other uses of blackpowder.

**Wounds: **Blackpower rolls with explosive weapons are subject to Drop
penalties from your Wounds.

**Time:** Firing a loaded weapon or detonating charges takes one action.
Setting or disarming explosives takes one minute. 

**Item Die:** Add the Weapon Die as an Item Die when using an explosive
weapon, or the Item Die of repair tools if setting, disarming, or
detonating explosives.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time setting or disarming a bomb to
add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by
your number of ranks in Science (Blackpowder), as shown on the following
table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Blackpowder Rank Required |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                       |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       | \+2                       |
| 15 minutes      | 1D8       | \+3                       |
| 1 hour          | 1D10      | \+4                       |
| 4 hours         | 1D12      | \+5                       |

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to set or disarm a bomb by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the task, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** When using an explosive weapon or detonating charges,
the Blackpowder roll is an automatic success and the success points are
used to select a target area and set the base damage of the explosion.
For setting or disarming explosives, the standard opposition is based on
the bomb's Explosion Dice.

| ++++:         | Disarm Explosives           |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Hit An Area:** You fire an explosive weapon into an area adjacent to
your own. For each additional success point you spend, you can move the
center of the explosion another area away from you, out to the maximum
range of the weapon.

**Base Damage +1 Wound:** For every two success points you spend,
increase the base damage by 1 Wound. This increase to the Wound damage
is limited to twice the number of ranks you have in Science
(Blackpowder).

**Set Timed Fuse:** You set a timed fuse in your area to detonate within
a given period of time. The default fuse for a standard bomb is one to
10 rounds, with the exact number of rounds being up to you. The bomb
detonates at the end of the chosen round, after everyone else has acted.

**Detonate Charges:** You immediately detonate a bomb in your own area
or an adjacent area. Alternately, you can use a Pistol or Musket within
its normal range or a thrown flame within Short range (1 to 2 Areas) to
perform this action. Add the Pistol or Musket's Weapon Die as an Item
Die, and apply any Drop Penalties due to the weapon's normal range.

**Expand Radius: **When setting explosives or firing artillery, you can
extend the radius of the blast by one step. "Close" becomes "Adjacent",
"Adjacent" becomes "Short", and so on, out to the maximum radius of the
explosives.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Disarm Explosives:** You disarm a bomb or other explosive device that
has not yet detonated.

#### Clockworks

*Affinity Specialty*

The Clockworks specialty allows you to create, repair, and customize
clockwork devices. For more details, see the list of clockwork devices
and components <a href="#clockworks-2" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a>.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify the functions and components of a
clockwork device, recall the names of famous mechanicians, determine
what components of a device are malfunctioning, read and understand
plans drawn by other clockworkers.

**Crafting: **Clockwork devices, components, power sources, and other
mechanical contrivances<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Time: **It takes one action to keep a device together or draw more
power from it. Sabotaging a device takes 1 minute. To repair a device or
salvage components from it takes 1 hour.

**Bonus Die:** If you have plans for the device you're working on, you
can add the bonus die from those plans to the roll, in addition to any
applicable Item Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time repairing, salving, or
sabotaging a device to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of
that die is limited by your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks), as
shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Clockworks Rank Required |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                      |

| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                      |

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to repair, salvage, or sabotage a
device by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job
that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends
on how much you rush the task, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |

| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

**Opposition:** The standard opposition for working with a clockwork
device is normally Easy (3D6). If you created or assembled the device
yourself, the roll is an automatic success and the success points are
used to determine how well you accomplished the task. For each component
in a device that is beyond your ability to create, based on your Science
(Clockworks) skill, increase the standard opposition by one step.

| \++++:        | Sabotage Device               |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Keep It Together:** You manage to patch the device together long
enough that one malfunction doesn't affect it until the end of the next
round. For each additional success point, you increase the duration by
another round.

**We Need More Power: **You manage to coax an extra point of power out
of a device's power source for every two success points you spend, with
a limit of extra power equal to your ranks in Science (Clockworks). The
increased power lasts until you spend it or the end of the next round.
At the end of the scene, the device gains one malfunction for every time
you boosted the power output.

**Repair 1 Malfunction:** You fix the device and remove a malfunction in
one of its components. Each malfunction removed requires the expenditure
of one unit of supplies of a type used to create the component.

**Salvage a Component:** You can remove one functioning component or
power source from the device, for use in later devices; this requires at
least an hour's worth of work. You can't salvage a malfunctioning or
destroyed component. Alternately, you can destroy a component or power
source to regain one unit of supplies of a type used to create the
component.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sabotage Machine:** You add a malfunction to one component in a
device. If you spend an extra success point, you can remove the
malfunction later by taking a single action to do so.

#### Calculus

*Guile Specialty*

The Calculus specialty includes all manner of calculations of numbers,
from adding sums to deriving mathematical equations. Experienced
merchants and moneylenders also use Calculus regularly in order to
balance their books, and mariners use Calculus to create their charts.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Read and understand the meaning behind complex
equations, recall the names of famous mathematicians and scientists.

**Crafting:** Calculations, clockwork plans, and mathematical theorems<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Opposition:** Use Easy (3D6) for calculations done in a well-equipped
workshop, or Moderate (3D8) for field work with paper and ink. Doing
calculations in your head is Hard (3D10).

| ++++:         | Complex Calculation   |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Simple Calculation:** You perform a simple calculation such as
determining the size or speed of an object. 

**Analytics:** You create a +1D0 Tag Die based one specialty that can be
used as a Bonus Die until the end of the scene. The Tag Die can only be
used in a roll that uses quantities, measurements, prices, or other
numbers. Examples include navigating with Nature (Explore), cooking food
with Nature (Husbandry), haggling over a price with Interaction
(Negotiate), or aiming a cannon with Science (Blackpowder). For every
two additional success points you spend, you can increase the Tag Die by
one size, with a limit based on your ranks in Science (Calculus) as
shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Calculus Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| \+1            | \+1D0           |
| \+2            | \+1D6           |
| \+3            | \+1D8           |
| \+4            | \+1D10          |
| \+5            | \+1D12          |

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Complex Calculation:** This is a more complicated type of mathematics,
usually involving polynomials or integrals. 


### Streetwise ## {.breakbefore}

Streetwise skill covers the ability to survive and prosper in a medium
or large city, sometimes relating to people of varying Social Ranks.
Streetwise characters are savvy to the right places in town to get
things done, and are good at trash-talking their opponents.

#### Banter

*Verve Specialty*

The Banter specialty lets you toss quips and insults both in and out of
a fight, trying to provoke a reaction of some kind. You can use Banter
to demoralize your foes or impress your audience.

**Language:** You can only use Banter on someone who can understand the 
language you're speaking.

**Knowledge Rolls:**  Remember embarrassing details about someone else's 
personal life, recall a scathing retort from a line of a play.

**Time:** Most uses of Banter take only 1 action to perform, although
spreading rumors takes 1 hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time spreading rumors to add a Bonus 
Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Streetwise (Banter), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Banter Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                  |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                  |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                  |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                  |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                  |

**Opposition:**  When directly confronting someone, your Banter roll is 
opposed by their own Banter roll. If you're spreading rumors, the
standard opposition is Easy (3D6) in a medium city and Moderate (3D8) in
a large city.

| ++++:         | Enrage Opponent                  |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Decrease Advantage:** If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease 
her die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she
has D6 Advantage.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already 
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how 
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every three 
Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her
Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Spread Rumor:**   You spread scurrilous yet believable lies about a 
rival. You create a +1D0 Tag Die based on a person, a place, an animal,
or an object involved in some scandalous way with your rival. You can
use the Tag Die as a Bonus Die on Interaction, Intuition, and Streetwise
rolls against your rival for 1 week (six days). The rumor can't be
easily traced back to you.

For one additional success point, you can extend the duration by one
day. For every 2 additional success points you spend, you can increase
the Tag Die by one step, to a maximum value based on your ranks in
Streetwise (Banter) as shown in the following table:

Table: Maximum Tag Die

| Banter Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| \+1          | \+1D0           |
| \+2          | \+1D6           |
| \+3          | \+1D8           |
| \+4          | \+1D10          |
| \+5          | \+1D12          |

**Enrage Opponent:** If you aren't in a fight already, you provoke your 
opponent into starting combat. If you are in combat, your opponent
will focus on you to the exclusion of other targets, until you're dead,
unconscious, or the fight ends.

#### Carouse

*Affinity Specialty*

The Carouse specialty involves frequenting establishments where liquor
is served and tongues accordingly flow more freely. Carousing in a
tavern or bar is a good way to pick up on the local rumors, and maybe
even learn some secrets from a drunken informant.

**Language:** If you don't speak one of the local languages, you get a 
Drop 2 penalty on Carouse rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Locate the best (or worst) taverns in town, 
identify the type and origin of liquor with a taste, recall your
companion(s) in previous drunken trysts.

**Crafting:** Beer, ale, wine, and other alcoholic beverages<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Item Die:** If you buy a round of drinks for everyone in a tavern, you 
can add the highest die in its cost to your Carousing roll as an Item
Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time carousing to add a Bonus Die to 
your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks
in Streetwise (Carousing), as shown on the following table:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Carousing Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

**Opposition:** The larger the city, the easier it is for you to get 
information or make a connection without drawing too much attention to
yourself. In anything smaller than a large town, the standard opposition
is Hard (3D10). In a large town or small city, the opposition is
Moderate (3D8), and in a large city, the opposition is Easy (3D6). If
you go carousing in your usual haunts -- because sometimes you want to
go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came --
the roll is an automatic success and the success points are used to
determine how well you performed the task.

two sources, but which still may or may not be true.

**Find a Companion:** You find someone with whom to spend the evening – 
be that an old soldier telling war stories, a romantic partner of a
gender of your choice, or a friendly bartender to hear your tale of woe.
You can locate them easily and enjoy their company another night for the
next week (6 days), and can increase that duration by one week for each
additional success point you spend.

town, such as the location of the secret entrance to the baroness's
vaults.

#### Larceny

*Guile Specialty*

The Larceny specialty is used for criminal endeavors, primarily theft.
You use Larceny rolls not only to steal objects but also fence them and
to purchase stolen goods on the black market.

**Knowledge Rolls:**  Estimate the value of a stolen object, evaluate the 
quality of a lock or door, recall the names and rap sheets of famous
criminals.

**Crafting:**  Locks, traps, alarms, and forgeries<a href="#crafting" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to perform a Larceny roll by taking
a Drop penalty on your die roll. The size of the Drop penalty depends on
how quickly you rush, as shown on the following table:

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Case the Joint:**   | You look around your own Area or an adjacent Area 
and learn one of the following pieces of information:

- The nearest exit, and whether it's locked
- The most valuable object you could carry, and whether it's unsecured
- The location of the nearest guard or other observer
- The location and trigger of a trap or alarm

Each additional Success Point you spend can tell you a different piece
of information, or the next item down within the same category. For
example, a second Success Point could tell you the second nearest exist,
the second-most valuable object, the location of the second-nearest
observer, or the location of an additional trap.

**Steal Something:** You can palm an unattended small item in your Area 
without being seen. For an extra 2 success points, you can remove a
small item from the pocket of someone in the same Area as you. If you
spend an additional 2 success points, you can move it to your pocket or
the pocket of someone else in your Area.

**Bypass Obstacle:** You can pick a lock, bypass a trap, or disable an 
alarm in your Area that would otherwise prevent you from engaging in
criminal activity. If you spend one additional success point, you can
reset the obstacle to become active again once you have left the Area. 

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how 
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Install Obstacle:** You can set a trap, alarm, or lock in your own 
area to trigger once you have left the Area. An Easy (3D6) Observation
roll is required for someone to notice the trap. For each additional 2
success points you spend, the difficulty of the Observation roll
increases by one step, limited by the number of skill ranks you have in
Larceny as shown on the following table:

Table: Maximum Observation Opposition

| Larceny Rank | Item Die              |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1            | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2            | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3            | Difficult (3D10)      |
| 4            | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| 5            | Very Difficult (3D12) |


## Style Maneuvers

This is a summary of all the style maneuvers available to player
characters. Each class and nationality choice gives players access to a
different set of maneuvers; these are the only ones that can be chosen
at character creation. 

### Types of Style Maneuvers

There are three types of Style Maneuvers: reroll maneuvers, maximize
maneuvers, and conditional maneuvers.

#### Reroll Maneuvers

A reroll maneuver lets you reroll your entire dice pool. You can
do this immediately after you roll, or you can do it after your opponent
rolls. You ignore your original results and only keep the rerolled
version.

Rerolling costs one Style Point, and you can repeat it if you have
enough Style Points.

#### Maximize Maneuvers

A maximize maneuver sets the value of one die in your pool to its
maximum value. You set that die aside and turn it to its maximum
value, before you roll. For example, if you maximize a D10, you set the
value to a 10. Then you roll your dice and calculate your result as if
the maximized value were one that you rolled.

The die you maximize must be one you include in your dice pool from
the associated specialty or item die. If you have a pool that consists
of 1D8 (Verve) + 1D6 (Competency) + 2D8 (Lunge) + 1D10 (Weapon Die) +
1D12 (Advantage Die), you can use a "maximize Lunge die" maneuver only
to maximize one of the D8s from Lunge.

Maximizing a die costs two Style Points, and you can only have one
maximized die in any dice pool. You can't a maximize maneuver after you
roll.

#### Conditional Maneuvers

A conditional maneuver has a specific condition that must be met in
order for you to use it. When you do so, you add the dice from one
source to a different dice pool. Adding the dice from a second
specialty doesn't give you the Attribute Die, Competency Die, or Item
Die from the second dice pool, but it does give you a number of dice
equal to your specialty ranks. The size of each such die is determined
by your attribute; if you have +2 Lunge and your Verve is D8, then you
add +2D8 to another pool as directed by the maneuver.

If you don't have any ranks at all in a specialty but you're
Competent with the appropriate Skill, you can instead add your
Competency Die as another Specialty die. If you aren't Competent with
the skill at all, you probably made a poor choice for a style maneuver;
you can add 1D6 to the roll instead as a Specialty Die.

Using a conditional maneuver requires one Style Point. If you meet
the criteria for multiple conditional maneuvers and you want to spend
the Style Points, you use as many such maneuvers as you like on one die
roll. You need to decide before you roll, not after.

When you add dice from one specialty to another roll, that second
roll also becomes a pool of that type in addition to its own. In other
words, if you have a maneuver that lets you "add Husbandry dice to a
Lunge" roll and you spend the Style Point to use it, the roll is both a
Lunge roll and a Husbandry roll. This can allow for adding in additional
style maneuvers as a combo.

MJ's Toolbox: New Style Maneuvers

As the MJ, you can create new Style Maneuvers that can be chosen by your players.

**Reroll maneuvers** cost one Style Point and allow for one broad type
of roll to be rerolled. For example, you could create a maneuver that
allows a reroll on Wealth rolls, attack rolls with a rapier, or rolls
that use one of the character's passions.

**Maximize maneuvers** cost two Style Points and allow one specific kind
of die to be maximized. Any given pool can only have one maximized die.
Examples of appropriate maneuvers include maximizing the Mount die of a
mount or a specific weapon die, such as a pistol. Don't make the
maneuver too specific; that's what conditional maneuvers are for.

**Conditional maneuvers** cost one Style Point and let the character add
dice from one specialty to another roll, but only under certain
conditions. The conditions you choose should be fairly specific and not
overly broad, but they should also be something that a determined player
could use at least once per game session, if not more often.

**Initiative maneuvers** don't exist, period. There aren't any Charms or
Style Maneuvers that add to Initiative rolls. You probably shouldn't
invent any, either; that limitation is there for a reason. You can,
however, create conditional maneuvers that add Initiative specialties to
other dice rolls.

Finally, you need to decide which classes, nationalities, or other
groups have access to the new maneuver. Perhaps it's a lost sword
technique only taught to students of a retired blademaster, or it's
commonly practiced by adult members of a house of the Ifran desert. It's
possible you might decide that no groups can freely choose your new
maneuver, in which case players will need to pay the additional XP cost
when choosing it.

Players, you don't have the option to create your own Style Maneuvers
whenever you want -- but you can always suggest one to your MJ and maybe
she'll like the idea\!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Equipment

In this chapter, we'll look at the mundane clothes, weapons, tools, and
other items that a cavalier might use during the course of her day.


### Wealth   {#anchor-wealth}

In *The Queen's Cavaliers*, money is treated as an abstract resource
rather than counting the exact number of Crowns, Sols, and Lunes that
your character is carrying. Your character's ability to purchase items
is represented by a composite Wealth pool, and goods or services are
rated by cost and availability.

#### Wealth Pools

A Wealth score for a player character is a pool based on the following
dice:

  - The character's two Social Rank scores
  - The character's Competency Die

A new Duelist/Charmweaver character would thus have a Wealth dice pool
consisting of 1D6 (Soldier social rank), 1D8 (Artisan social rank), and
1D6 (starting Competency die), for a total of 1D8+2D6.

Wealth pools can become depleted by making successful Wealth rolls
during the course of a game session, as described below. At the start of
each session, a character's Wealth pool is restored to its original
value.

#### Purchase Costs and Availability

Each item or service that you can buy has a cost, as shown on the
equipment lists. For example, a dagger is 1D0, a leather jerkin is 1D6,
and an airship is 4D12.

The availability of the item is dependent upon where you are and how
common the item is, as determined by the MJ based on the following
table.

Table: Availability

| Availability | Die | Skill Required |
| ------------ | --- | -------------- |
| Very Common  | D0  | Apprentice     |
| Common       | D6  | Journeyman     |
| Uncommon     | D8  | Expert         |
| Rare         | D10 | Master         |
| Very Rare    | D12 | Grandmaster    |

There are no set values for availability, but as a general rule the
highest die in an item's cost is often equal to its availability rating,
or the level of skill required to create the item, whichever is higher. 

The MJ can change the availability based on the geographic location; for
example, if you are in Lutetia, it's Very Common to find a sword, while
in the Provinces it might be Very Common to buy a draft horse.

The dice pool opposing a Wealth roll is equal to the cost plus the
availability. Buying a sword in Lutetia would be D6 (cost) plus D0
(availability), or 1D6. Buying an Airship in Lutetia is 4D12 (cost) plus
1D12 (availability), or 5D12, since airships are very rarely available
for purchase.

#### Making a Wealth Roll

A Wealth roll represents the character's attempt to locate goods or
services, leverage her material assets and personal favors, and purchase
said item. The player makes a roll of her Wealth pool against the cost
and availability, rolled by the MJ.

If the MJ's roll is higher, the character is unable to purchase the item
in question – her personal lines of credit are exhausted, she's low on
cash, there's not one available for the right price, or any other
explanation. This is an opportunity for the MJ and the player to
cooperatively introduce a plot element to describe why the purchase
didn't go through. 

In addition, on a failed Wealth roll, the character drops one die from
her Wealth pool. This is marked on the character sheet by a checkbox.
Dropped dice cannot be used again during the same game session, although
they are restored at the beginning of the next game session.

If the player wins the opposed Wealth roll, she still drops one die from
her Wealth pool to represent the expenditure of resources, and spends
her success points on the following success table:

:::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::
| Wealth Rolls |                       |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Opposition   | Cost and availability |
| \+           | Purchase Item         |
| \++++        | No Drop               |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Purchase Item:** You can purchase the item or service in question. If
the item has a B beside the cost, it can be purchased in bulk, and each
success point you spend gives you one more of the item; otherwise, you
can only purchase the item or service once.

**No Drop:** You don't drop a die from your Wealth pool because of this
roll.

#### Dropped Dice

Dropped dice are restored at the start of the next game session. You can
(and probably should) drop a D0 die if it is in your Wealth pool; it's
always best to drop your lowest die rather your highest die.

If you get enough success points on your Wealth roll, you don't have to
drop any dice.

You can't choose to drop Barter or Reward dice when you make a Wealth
roll, as they are not a permanent part of your Wealth pool.

#### Buying in Bulk

Certain items in the equipment list can be purchased in bulk; these are
marked by a \[B\] after the cost. For those items, and only those items,
you can buy multiple quantities by expending additional success points.

If you are spending a Reward, you get a quantity of items equal to half
your Reward die size when buying items in bulk. For example, if you
spend a D8 reward on fabric (cost D6), you get 4 pieces of fabric.

#### Charmwoven Items

You purchase a Charmwoven item in the same way that you purchase
anything else – but the cost is equal to the base cost of the item plus
the Charm die. This is in addition to the availability, which in most
cases is equal to the Charm die as well.

For example, if you wish to purchase a cavalier hat with a D8 Charm for
Dueling (Riposte), the cost will be D6 for the hat, D8 for the Charm,
and D8 for finding an Expert charmweaver, for a total of 2D8+1D6 as the
opposition to your Wealth roll.

By comparison, an uncharmed cavalier hat would cost D6 plus D0
availability in Lutetia (they're all the rage these days), for a total
of 1D6.

#### Cost D0

An item with a cost of D0 is not free; it still requires a successful
Wealth roll to purchase and thus a die dropped (or a D0 or higher Reward
to purchase without rolling).

Likewise, a D0 Reward actually is something, but it doesn't do much
except let you purchase a single D0 item (such as a knife).

A D0 Barter die has no value, however, so you don't need to bother with
those.

#### Barter Dice

When you sell items, you gain Barter dice equal to the cost (not the
availability) of the item. Barter dice are recorded on the character
sheet below the Wealth pool, and can be included in a Wealth roll
whenever you wish. However, after being successfully used once, Barter
dice are expended.

You can include as many Barter dice as you have in any given roll, or
you can save them as long as you wish.

On a failed Wealth roll, any Barter dice used are not expended, and can
be used again in the future.

For example, if you want to sell your riding horse (cost D8), you gain a
D8 Barter die. If you then turn around and buy a warhorse, you can
choose to add the D8 to your Wealth roll.

#### Rewards

A Reward is a more tangible, less abstract quantity of Wealth, usually
bequeathed by a non-player character. Such Rewards could include a grant
from the Queen, a bounty for capturing a wanted criminal, or a prize for
winning a tournament.

Each Reward has a die value associated with it, from D0 to D12. You can
use a Reward to automatically purchase, without making a Wealth roll,
any item or service which is equal to or less than the Reward's die
value.

New characters begin the game with three Rewards, equal in value to the
dice in their Wealth pool. Additional Rewards should be granted by the
MJ. A typical good deed may net a Reward equal to the player characters'
Competency die, while capturing a fugitive could earn a Reward equaling
the criminal's Competency die.

#### Gallinean Currency

The most common coinage used in Gallinea is the Sol, a silver coin
roughly analogous to a modern dollar. A Lune is a copper coin equal to
1/12 of a Sol, while a gold Crown is 12 Sols.

Crowns are stamped with a portrait of the current monarch. Sols have a
sun pattern, and Lunes show a crescent moon.

The approximate values of an item, Barter die, or Reward are shown on
the following table.

Table: Gallinean Currency

| Die | Cost            | Barter Die Value | Reward Value     |
| :-: | :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| D0  | 1-12 Lunes      | 1 Lune           | 12 Lunes (1 Sol) |
| D6  | 1-6 Sols        | 1 Sol            | 6 Sols (½ Crown) |
| D8  | 1-8 Crowns      | 1 Crown          | 8 Crowns         |
| D10 | 10-100 Crowns   | 10 Crowns        | 100 Crowns       |
| D12 | 100-1200 Crowns | 100 Crowns       | 1200 Crowns      |

These numbers are just to facilitate roleplay; you don't use the actual
values except for description. For example, the MJ might say, “She
plunks down a small sack of Crowns on the table” to represent a D8
reward, or state that an airship (cost 4D12) is worth nearly 5,000
Crowns.

Gallinea's neighboring countries have their own currencies but they are
usually interchangeable with Gallinean coins as they're based on the
ancient Qartan money system.

### Item Scale

Every item has a scale that describes the general size of the item:
pocket scale, handheld scale, portable scale, human scale, furniture
scale, room scale, and building scale. In general, it's easy enough to
determine the scale of most items, but for some items a scale is
explicitly listed in the lists that follow.

The scale concept is used in the optional rules for Encumbrance, later
in this chapter, as well as for clockwork devices <a href="#clockworks-2" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a> 
and animals <a href="#animals" class="xref-inchapter"></a>.

#### Pocket Scale

A pocket-scale device is light, easily concealed, requires only one hand
to operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing
without attracting undue notice. Examples include small pistols or
knives, flasks of alchemical brews, and a pet mouse. 

Weapons of this size are classified as Either Hand weapons.

#### Handheld Scale

A handheld item usually requires one hand to operate and can be carried
on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Most can't be easily
concealed unless you're willing to forego easy access. Examples include
most swords, tool kits, bucklers, and large hats.

When describing animals, such as cats or small dogs, handheld scale is
known as pet scale. Weapons of this size are classified as Main Hand
weapons.

#### Portable Scale

A portable-scale item is one which requires two hands to carry and
operate, or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Examples include
two-handed swords, muskets, and bar stools.

The equivalent scale for animals is companion scale. A portable-scale
weapon is classified a Both Hands weapon.

#### Human Scale

An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue or a suit of
rigid armor – can't be easily carried by a single person without
requiring her full attention. Other examples include work carts, heavy
chairs, and velocipedes.

#### Furniture Scale

Larger than a human but smaller than a room, a carriage-scale item is
around the size of a bed, a wardrobe dresser, or a small carriage. At
best, an adult human can drag a furniture-scale item around but can't
pick it up. Other furniture-scale items are horses, rowboats, and
thrones.

In descriptions of animals, furniture scale is known as mount scale.

#### Room Scale

Room-scale items can be rooms themselves, the amount of furnishings it
takes to fill up a room, or an object of comparable size. In combat,
each room-scale item is usually its own Area.

Mammoth scale is the equivalent of room scale when describing animals.

#### Building Scale

Building-scale items include buildings, of course, but also large
vehicles such as sailing ships or airships. In combat situations, a
building-scale object is usually divided into multiple Areas.

When talking about animals this large, such as giant squids or great
whales, the term behemoth scale is used.


::::::::::::::::::::::::: option ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Optional Rule: Encumbrance

This is an optional rule that the MJ can use if it will enhance her
game. In most cases, the calculations are more effort than they're worth
and rarely provide any actual change in the game. However, if the
players start carrying around dozens of heavy items, the MJ might decide
that this use can help bring her players' gear into line with her
expectations for the game. *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a swashbuckling
action game, and not about lugging around heavy weights\!

### Carrying Limit

A human carrying a Person-sized object takes a Drop 2 penalty on attack
rolls (Dueling, Brawl, and Aim), and cannot move more than one area in a
given turn. Humans cannot usually move items of Carriage size or higher,
unless it's got wheels or something similar.

*Example:* You pick up an unconscious colleague and carry her over your
shoulders. That's obviously a Person-sized object, so you get a Drop 2
penalty and can't run.

### Combining Encumbrance

Three items of a smaller size are equivalent to one item of larger size.
So three Portable items are as bulky and heavy as one Person-sized
object -- meaning if you're carrying a musket, a zweihander, and a pike
(all Portable-sized objects), you've got the equivalent of a
Person-sized object and take the Drop 2 penalty, plus you can't run.

Three Pocket-sized items equal a Handheld object; three Handheld-sized
items equal a Portable object; and three Portable-sized items equal a
Person-sized object. You could carry eight Handheld objects -- say, a
cutlass, a buckler, and a brace of six pistols tied together by rope --
and not be slowed down, because that only equals two Portable items,
which is less than a Person-sized object.

### Worn Items

Items that are specifically designed to be worn -- and which can't be
removed easily during the middle of a fight (and sometimes, even after a
fight) -- count as one size lower for purposes of encumbrance when worn.
A suit of armor is normally Person-sized, but if you're wearing it, it
counts as Portable-sized. (If you're trying to carry an empty suit of
armor, though, it counts as Person-sized.) A worn breastplate (Portable)
counts as a Handheld item. 

Pocket-sized items which are worn don't count at all for encumbrance
purposes, unless you're wearing three of the same kind -- for example, a
worn wrist holster (Pocket) or two doesn't weigh you down at all. Three
worn wrist holsters, however, would equal a Pocket-sized objects -- base
size of Pocket, stepped up to Handheld for three of them, then stepped
down again to Pocket size for being worn.

Clothing of any type never counts for calculating encumbrance -- it's
all considered Pocket size (regardless of actual size) and thus is not
included when worn unless you're doing something silly like wearing
three different capes at the same time.

### Other Things That Don't Weigh Very Much

Medicine, alchemy supplies, draughts and unguents, poisons, and other
small consumables don't count for encumbrance unless you've got 9 of
them, in which case they count as a Pocket-sized object. Ammunition and
powder for your guns, arrows for your crossbows and bows, and other
types of ammo don't ever count; they're included with the weapon itself
(especially as they're not tracked in *The Queen's Cavaliers*).

Other supplies (art supplies, blackpowder supplies, clockwork gears,
fabric, foodstuffs) count as one Pocket-size object for every three
units you carry. So if you're carrying, say, 10 units of clockwork
gears, that counts as three Pocket-size objects, or 1 Handheld object.
Two or fewer units of these supplies don't count for encumbrance
purposes.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Clothing

#### Clothing Qualities

Articles of clothing have the following qualities:

**Worn On:** Each article of clothing is designed to be worn on a
specific part of your body -- head, shoulders, torso, hands, legs, or
feet. In general, you can wear only one item per location, although you
may be able to stack multiple cloaks on your shoulders under certain
circumstances -- check with your MJ to be sure.

Items worn on or over the legs can't have charms woven into them. 

**Social Rank:** Some items are associated with certain social ranks.
This doesn't restrict what you can wear, regardless of your own social
rank, but it may affect how you and your outfit are seen by others. The
social rank of an article of clothing can be used as an availability die
in a purchase roll.

**Scale:** Articles of clothing are usually handheld scale when carried,
and don't contribute to encumbrance when worn if the optional system for
encumbrance is used. Items wrapped up in a box for gifting or transport
are one scale category higher, including the packaging.

The following table lists the most common types of clothes that are
found in Gallinea. Detailed descriptions of each type of clothing are
given <a href="#articles-of-clothing" class="xref-insection"></a>.

#### Standard outfits

Many outfits just naturally go together. Every new character starts with
one or two standard outfits depending on her class and backstory. In
addition to sharing a common cost, outfits are all considered part of
the same social rank, regardless of the actual social rank of each
item.

Table: outfits

| Item                | Cost    | Includes                                                             |
| :------------------ | :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clockworker outfit  | 2D6     | Gearspring goggles, smock, breeches, craftsman's gloves, pantofles   |
| Corsair outfit      | 4D6     | Tricorne, doublet, soldier's gloves, pantaloons, boots               |
| Courtly outfit      | 3D6     | Hair ribbons, bodice, courtier's gloves, skirt, chopines             |
| Crafter outfit      | 2D6     | Artisan's beret, smock, breeches, craftsman's gloves, buckled shoes  |
| Military outfit     | 2D6     | Capotain, soldier's gloves, breeches, boots, tabard                  |
| Peasant outfit      | 1D6     | Shift, breeches, buckled shoes                                       |
| Physician outfit    | 3D6     | Plague mask, surgeon's gown, breeches, pantofles                     |
| Priest outfit       | 2D6     | Clerical skullcap, vestments, courtier's gloves, breeches, pantofles |
| Scholar's outfit    | 1D6+1D8 | Ornate stole, robes, breeches, poulaines                             |
| Swashbuckler outfit | 4D6     | Cavalier hat, doublet, soldier's gloves, breeches, boots, cloth cape |

**Clockworker outfit (Artisan 1D8):** This is worn while doing
mechanician work, and usually has a lot of extraneous pockets and loops
for tools and gears. The most notable feature is the set of gearspring
goggles, which give an item die bonus of Perceive +1D6 on visual checks.

**Corsair outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Worn by sailors and pirates around the
world, and by many would-be buccaneers, this outfit certainly captures
the look of the chic privateer.

**Courtly outfit (Noble 1D10):** Nobles, and those who must interact
with them, are known for their outlandishly ornate couture and finely
arranged coiffure.

**Crafter outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Similar to a clockworker outfit, a
crafter outfit is for doing productive work, be it artistic, magickal,
or smithing in content.

**Military outfit (Soldier 1D6):** Military outfits come with an
appropriate tabard from the correct military unit, noble house,
mercenary group, or city guard. For example, a veteran/constable may
have one tabard from the Gallinean army, and another from the Lutetia
watch. Military outfits don't come with a torso item, to facilitate the
wearing of armor.

**Peasant outfit (Commoner 1D0):** Plain and practical, peasant outfits
can be found throughout Gallinea, and in nearly every social rank. As
they're easily patched, many peasant outfits are simply stitched
together from different types and colors of fabric. Lately, the upper
social ranks have tried to adopt this patchwork style, albeit with
little success.

**Physician outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The notable feature of this outfit
is the large, vaguely bird-shaped mask used during surgery; the beak of
this mask contains herbs and cloth meant to filter out diseases. Most
physician outfits start out white in color, but quickly become stained
with crimson.

**Priest outfit (Artisan 1D8):** The traditional dress of Asrian clergy
varies by their rank within the church. Lower-ranking chaplains wear
outfits of brighter, primary colors while those higher in the hierarchy
are allowed additional colors that are darker and more complex. 

**Scholar's outfit (Artisan 1D8):** Students and instructors at
universities, seminaries, officer schools, and other institutions of
higher learning are expected to dress in traditional scholarly robes
while teaching or attending classes. Outside of class, of course,
they're free to wear whatever they want.

**Swashbuckler outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The cavalier hat, the billowing
cape, the high boots -- anyone wearing this outfit cuts a dashing figure
indeed. While some such outfits are more sedate and refined, many look
as if the wearer stepped out of the latest Alais Neversette novella.


### Weapons

While *The Queen's Cavaliers* is not entirely focused around combat,
it's still a swashbuckling game -- so swords, muskets, and cannons play
a role in the stories being told.

In game terms, there are three broad categories that weapons fall into:
dueling, aimed, and explosive.

**Dueling Weapon:** A weapon that can be used in close-quarters combat
with one or more of the Dueling (Lunge), Dueling (Riposte), Dueling
(Feint), or Defense (Parry) specialties. Examples are swords, knives,
quarterstaves, and pikes.

**Aimed Weapon:** A weapon that can be used at range with the Military
(Aim) specialty. These include crossbows, muskets, pistols, and some
thrown weapons.

**Explosive Weapon:** Unlike some aimed weapons which also use
blackpowder, such as flintlock pistols or muskets, aiming an explosive
weapon isn't the problem. It's preventing yourself from blowing up in
the process. To make an attack with explosives, you use the Science
(Blackpowder) specialty. This category includes cannons, grenades, and
bombs.

::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#### Free Starting Weapon

When you create your character for *The Queen's Cavaliers*, you get a
free weapon in addition to any granted by your classes and any
additional weapons you might also buy. If you don't want a free weapon,
you can instead take a +1D6 Barter die.

You can pick from the following basic weapons:

 - **Cutlass** (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)
 - **Dagger** (Knife +1D6, Either Hand)
 - **Flintlock Pistol** (Pistol +1D6, Either Hand)
 - **Rapier** (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)
 - **Sabre** (Sword +1D6, Main Hand, Cavalry)
 - **Smallsword** (Sword +1D6, Either Hand)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Weapon Qualities

There are four qualities possessed by all weapons: the type of Weapon
Prowess needed to use it, the Weapon Die that can be added as an Item
Die to your dice pools, the number of Hands you need to use to attack
effectively with one, and the Specialties with which that weapon can be
used. Some weapons also possess Success Table Additions which give you
additional ways to spend success points when making certain kinds of
rolls with the weapon.

**Weapon Prowess:** Weapon Prowess is your knowledge of the basics of
how to attack and defend with that weapon. There are nine types of
Weapon Prowess: bow, cudgel, knife, musket, net, pistol, polearm, sword,
and whip. All player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* automatically
have Knife Prowess.

**Weapon Die:** You can add the Weapon Die to a Dice Pool as an Item Die
if you have the appropriate prowess for the weapon. If you lack prowess
in a weapon, you can still use the weapon -- you just don't get to add
the Weapon Die to your pool.

**Hands:** Some weapons can be used freely in either hand, others
require two hands to use, and some are just intended for main-hand use.
These are represented by the following weapon qualities:

 - **Main Hand:** This weapon can be used in one hand. You can have
    another weapon in your other hand, but it must be usable in Either
    Hand. 
  - **Either Hand:** This weapon also requires only one hand to use, but
    unlike a Main Hand weapon, you can wield one in each hand (known as
    "dual wielding") or as a secondary weapon with a Main Hand weapon in
    your primary hand.
  - **Both Hands:** You need both hands to use this weapon.

**Scale:** The scale of a weapon depends on the number of hands
required to use it. Unless stated otherwise, Main Hand weapons are
considered handheld scale, Either Hand weapons are pocket scale, and
Both Hand weapons are portable scale.

**Specialties:** These qualities list the specific specialties that can
be used with that weapon. If a specialty isn't listed, it's up to the MJ
whether it's possible to use the weapon that way, and what kind of Drop
penalty you'll receive; for example, using Parry with a musket or Aim
with a rapier could have pretty heavy penalties -- Drop 2 for the
musket, Drop 4 for the rapier.

  - **Aim:** Any attack with handheld weapons made at range uses the Aim
    specialty, from throwing a knife to firing a musket. If you have
    prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add its Weapon Die to
    your Aim roll as an Item Die.

  - **Block:** Defense (Block) allows the use of armor and general
    toughness to throw off the effects of an attack. It can be used to
    negate attacks from either Dueling or Aimed weapons. You add your
    armor's Armor Die to your Block roll as an Item Die if you have
    Armor Prowess in that item.

  - **Brawl:** Only a few Dueling weapons can be used as part of a
    Military (Brawl) attack or defense; Brawl usually doesn't use an
    Item Die of any kind. Brawl can be used to inflict Yield, to disarm
    or knock down an opponent, or to defend against a Brawl attack.

  - **Feint:** The primary use of Dueling (Feint) is to build Advantage
    during a fight through tricky maneuvering or a false attack to draw
    the your opponent off-guard. It can also inflict Yield or trigger a
    Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add
    its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die, although you can
    perform a Feint without a weapon also.

  - **Lunge:** A Lunge is a straightforward attack against an opponent
    using a Dueling weapon, usually by stabbing, chopping, slashing, or
    bashing. It's the best way to inflict either Yield or Wounds on your
    target. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, add its
    Weapon Die to your Lunge roll as an Item Die.

  - **Parry:** This specialty of the Defense skill can be used to negate
    incoming attacks from Dueling weapons, and if possible, trigger a
    Riposte. You need to have a weapon, improvised or otherwise, in your
    hand to attempt a Parry. If you have prowess in that weapon, add its
    Weapon Die to your Parry roll as an Item Die.

  - **Riposte:** Dueling (Riposte) is a triggered Dueling attack
    that you can use by spending success points from another specialty
    -- either Defense (Parry) or Dueling (Feint). A successful Riposte
    can inflict Yield or Wounds, or decrease your opponent's Advantage.
    The Defense (Parry) specialty cannot be used to defend against a
    Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you're using, you can add
    its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die.

**Success Table Additions:** Some weapons have additions to the success
tables for specific specialties, such as Knockdown or additional damage.
These are represented by the + notation for success points, such as
Lunge (+++: Unhorse).

#### Dueling Weapons

Dueling weapons are, by definition, weapons that can be used with the
Dueling skill and its specialties -- Lunge, Riposte, Feint, and Defense
(Parry). Not all weapons can be used with all specialties, however.

**Dueling Weapon Prowess:** The types of Weapon Prowess used with
dueling weapons are:

  - **Cudgel Prowess:** Any Dueling weapon used to bludgeon someone is a
    cudgel.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Net Prowess:** A net can be used as a Dueling weapon, although
    it's much more common to see this in Ekalia than in Gallinea.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** A polearm is any long-hafted Dueling weapon,
    typically (but not always) with the Reach quality. 
  - **Sword Prowess:** A Dueling weapon with a blade and a hilt. The
    pointy end goes in the other guy.
  - **Whip Prowess:** Whips are usually used in one hand, and most have
    Reach.

**Dueling Weapon Qualities:** In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, dueling weapons could have two additional qualities.

  - **Cavalry:** A dueling weapon with the Cavalry quality must be
    used with your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding
    a mount, you can substitute the mount's Item Die for your Weapon Die
    against an unmounted opponent.
  - **Reach:** A dueling weapon with Reach can be used to attack into an
    adjacent area as well as your own.

**Success Table Additions for Dueling Weapons:** Some dueling weapons
have additions to the success tables for specific specialties, such as
Knockdown or additional damage. These are represented by the + notation
for success points after the specialty name, such as Lunge (+++:
Unhorse). On a success with a weapon possessing that quality, you could
spend 3 success points to knock your target off her horse.

  - **Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade or hilt. You can only
    do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or
    if you are performing a Parry yourself. A broken weapon is useless
    except as an improvised weapon.
  - **Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using
    to attack you or the weapon she's using to Parry your attack. (This
    can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to
    choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an
    adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Execute a Riposte:** You can make a Riposte attack. This is the
    only way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful
    use of a Specialty or weapon with this effect on its Success Table.
  - **Grab:** You can snag an item worn by your target as long as you
    can see it, the item is Handheld size or smaller, and it's not being
    held by your opponent. You get to choose if the item ends up on the
    ground in your Area, or in your hand if you have one free.
  - **Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Inflict 2 Wounds:** Your opponent takes two Wounds. If she takes
    more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is
    dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a
    lower cost than usual.
  - **Knockdown:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or
    in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can
    result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage.
    Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense
    rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up; standing up is a Drop 1
    combined action.
  - **Restrain:** You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon,
    holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1
    penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional
    Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to
    a maximum of Drop 4. Your opponent can escape by making a simple
    check against Standard Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon
    attack. On a success, your opponent can break your weapon, let it
    fall in their Area, or grab it themselves.
  - **Unhorse:** If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that
    mount and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them
    falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your
    mount can make a trample attack right now for free, if it has that
    quality. Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and
    defense rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up. Standing up is a
    Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3
    penalty.

##### Availability of Dueling Weapons

As stated <a href="#anchor-wealth" class="xref-insection"></a>, to purchase any item you must roll
against a pool consisting of that item's availability and its cost.

Common dueling weapons are those which aren't hard at all to find any
settlement of decent size, and even in some smaller towns. Those are
listed in the following tables.

The availability of common weapons is almost always 1D0 in settlements
of any size. The exceptions are cutlass, rapier, sabre, and smallsword
-- the common swords -- in a small rural settlement. In such situations,
the availability increases to 1D6.

Table: Common Dueling Weapons

| Weapon       | Cost | Hands          | Weapon Die  | Specialties                         |
| :----------- | :--: | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Buckler      | D6   | Either         | Shield +1D8 | Parry, Block                        |
| Club         | D0   | Main           | Cudgel +1D6 | Lunge                               |
| Cutlass      | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Dagger       | D6   | Either         | Knife +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Aim   |
| Quarterstaff | D0   | Both           | Cudgel +1D6 | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint, Brawl |
| Rapier       | D6   | Main           | Sword +1D8  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |
| Sabre        | D6   | Main (Cavalry) | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Feint                 |
| Smallsword   | D6   | Either         | Sword +1D6  | Parry, Lunge, Riposte, Feint        |


  - **Buckler:** A buckler is a small shield that can be strapped to your forearm, usually on your non-dominant hand. You can hold an item in that hand but trying to attack with that hand while wearing a buckler gives you a Drop 2 penalty on rolls using either the buckler or that weapon.
  - **Club:** A standard club is simply a piece of wood or metal that you can swing at someone. It's not very sophisticated, but then again, you can likely pick one up wherever you are at any given time.  
  - **Cutlass:** The favored weapon of buccaneers, pirates, and other sailors.
  - **Dagger:** A dagger is a large knife that can also be thrown using the Aim specialty.
  - **Quarterstaff:** A medium-sized pole wielded in both hands that can also be used in a Brawl dice pool as well.
  - **Rapier:** The most common type of Sword in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a sharp, pointy weapon that can be used for all types of fencing.
  - **Sabre:** A lighter and faster weapon, the sabre is designed to be used from horseback although it functions equally well when dismounted.
  - **Smallsword:** Effectively a smaller, lighter version of a rapier, a smallsword can be used in the same way -- or you could dual-wield two of them if you want.

Uncommon dueling weapons have an availability of 1D0 in a capital city,
1D6 in any other city, and 1D8 in villages and other rural areas. The
one exception is that a bullwhip always has an availability of
1D0.

Foreign Weapons

In addition to the common and uncommon dueling weapons listed in the
previous tables and aimed weapons later in this chapter, the nations
that comprise Elara and Ifran have their own weapons as well. These
national weapons are described <a href="#the-countries-of-elara" class="xref-inchapter"></a>
and <a href="#the-countries-of-ifran" class="xref-inchapter"></a>, 

  - **Albia:** claymore, dirk, longbow, tuck
  - **Ekalia:** brandestoc, cinquedea, hook prothesis
  - **Northern Ifran:** horsebow, jambiya, shamshir
  - **Ondala:** espada ropera, montante
  - **Talania:** koncerz, szabla
  - **Varendia:** colichedemarde, katzbalger, zweihander

The availability of foreign dueling weapons is the same as that of
uncommon weapons -- 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and
1D8 in villages -- at least, when you're in that foreign country.

For neighboring countries, the availability of foreign dueling weapons
is 1D6 in a capital city, 1D8 in any other city, and 1D12 in villages.
In far-distant countries, the availability increases to 1D8 in a capital
city, 1D12 in any other city, and unavailable in smaller settlements.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Aimed Weapons

An Aimed weapon is one that can be used with the Military (Aim)
specialty. Larger ranged weapons are usually explosive weapons and use
the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks.

**Aimed Weapon Prowess:** There are five types of weapon prowess that
are used with Aimed weapons. You can add the weapon's Item Die to the
dice pool when making an attack roll with Aim if you have the
appropriate weapon prowess.

  - **Bow Prowess:** Bows, including crossbows, use the Aim specialty to
    attack, and fire arrows or bolts.
  - **Knife Prowess:** In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you
    can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.
  - **Musket Prowess:** Muskets are an Aimed weapon with longer range
    than pistols, usually doing more damage and taking longer to reload.
  - **Pistol Prowess:** An Aimed pistol can be fired with one hand.
  - **Polearm Prowess:** Apart from their use as dueling weapons, some
    polearms -- namely, spears -- can be thrown with the Aim skill.

Aimed Weapon Qualities: In addition to the qualities common to all
weapons, there are five that apply to Aimed weapons: the time needed to
reload, and the effectiveness of the weapon at close, short, medium, and
long ranges.

  - **Reload:** For Aimed weapons that require ammunition, the Reload
    quality indicates what kind of Drop penalty is imposed when
    combining the Reload action with another action. Most muskets have a
    Reload value of Drop 3, and pistols of Drop 2.
  - **Close** Range**:** The Close Range quality is the Drop penalty
    imposed when firing an Aimed weapon at a target within your own
    area. Larger weapons such as bows or muskets tend to have a Drop
    penalty at Close Range.
  - **Short** Range**:** A target that is one or two areas away is at
    Short Range. With very few exceptions, nearly all Aimed weapons have
    no Drop penalty at Short Range.
  - **Medium** Range**:** Medium Range is three or four areas. Most
    Aimed weapons have a Drop penalty at Medium Range. If a weapon
    doesn't have a listed Medium Range, it can't be used to effectively
    attack at that distance.
  - **Long Range:** At five or more areas distant, a target is at
    Long Range. All Aimed weapons that can be used at this distance have
    at least a Drop 1 penalty. If there is no Long Range listed for a
    weapon, it can't be used to attack at Long Range.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Maximum Range?

The tables below don't specify a maximum distance for long range. That's
because areas are an abstract representation of distance, not exact
measurements. Under ideal conditions, a weapon that has the long range
quality could reach 10 or more areas away, depending on how the areas
are set up for that encounter; in a crowded city street, the effective
range will be much lower.

Ultimately it's up to the MJ to decide what the maximum effective range
is for any weapon used at extreme long range, although usually not more
than 10 areas.

| Rifled Musket    | D8   | Both           | Musket +1D10 | Drop 4 | Drop 1 | Drop 0 | Drop 0 | Drop 1 |
| Thrown Dagger    | D0   | Either         | Knife +1D6   |        | Drop 0 | Drop 0 |        |        |
| Thrown Spear     | D6   | Main           | Polearm +1D6 |        | Drop 1 | Drop 0 | Drop 1 |        |

  - **Arbalest:** Also known as a heavy crossbow, the arbalest is harder to use than a common crossbow but packs a larger punch.
  - **Arquebus:** A smaller and lighter musket with shorter range and less firepower.
  - **Blunderbuss:** The flared barrel of this musket makes it easier to reload, but also reduces its effective range.
  - **Caliver:** Another type of musket that can reload faster without the reduced range of the blunderbuss, but with a smaller Weapon Die.
  - **Composite Bow:** A heavier bow with longer effective range and pull.  
  - **Crossbow:** The crossbow uses stored mechanical power to fire bolts, instead of relying upon personal muscle power as a normal bow does.
  - **Double Musket:** The primary advantage of this double-barreled musket is the ability to fire twice, once per barrel, without reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D12, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double musket with a Drop 3 action.
  - **Double Pistol:** Like the double musket, the double pistol allows one shot per barrel without having to reload. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D8, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it's harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double pistol with a Drop 2 action.
  - **Dragon:** This heavier version of a pistol is favored by cavalry -- especially Dragoons, who take their name from the use of this large pistol.
  - **Flintlock Musket:** This is a standard musket used by infantry throughout Elara.
  - **Flintlock Pistol:** A single-barrel pistol found all over Elara and Ifran.
  - **Hunting Bow:** This standard bow, also called a shortbow or flatbow, has been used for millennia in pretty much every nation.
  - **Rifled Musket:** With a rifled barrel to provide better accuracy at long range, this musket is the favored weapon of snipers.
  - **Thrown Dagger:** A dagger doesn't have be reloaded, but you take a Drop 1 penalty to draw it as you would with any other weapon -- and once it's thrown, you don't have it any more.
  - **Thrown Spear:** Like a dagger, a thrown spear must be drawn first but doesn't require ammunition.

:::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
###### Ammunition

Firing a musket or pistol uses a small amount of blackpowder and a
bullet, while a bow requires an arrow. 

However, in the *The Queen's
Cavaliers*, strict tracking of ammunition and powder doesn't contribute
to the swashbuckling adventure style of the genre. If you have an Aimed
weapon that has a Reload value, you're assumed to have enough powder,
bullets, or arrows to fire your weapon and reload it as many times as
necessary. 

This applies even if you use someone else's weapon, or a
weapon you just picked up -- you just don't track ammo for Aimed weapons
in *The Queen's Cavaliers*. Except, of course, for explosive weapons.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Explosive Weapons

Unlike conventional weapons, which use Dueling or Military (Aim) rolls
for attack, explosive weapons affect an entire area and inflict damage
on every creature, object, or other target within that area.

### Armor

Armor is any kind of clothing or shield used to protect the wearer from
attacks. Unlike normal clothing, most types of armor can't be enchanted
by charmweaving. Armor provides an item die, also known as an Armor Die,
that can be used on Block rolls. As with all other item dice, you can't
include more than one Armor Die in any dice pools.

There are three types of armor: Flexible, Rigid, and Shield. Each type
has its own associated armor prowess; if you wear armor of that type but
lack the appropriate prowess, you take a Drop 2 penalty on all combat
rolls (Defense, Dueling, Brawl, Aim).

**Flexible armor:** This type of armor is usually lighter and more
comfortable to wear, although it may not fully protect the wearer. If
you are wearing flexible armor, you can't wear an additional article of
clothing on your torso (although all armor includes sufficient
undergarments for the armor to be worn).

**Rigid armor:** Solid plates of steel or iron provide the defensive
value of a suit of rigid armor. Like flexible armor, you can wear either
armor or torso attire, but not both.

**Shields:** A shield is carried in one hand and can be used for both
Block and Parry rolls. You can't include more than one Armor Die in any
dice pool, so you can't combine the Armor Dice of a shield and armor.

The following table lists the types of armor commonly found in Gallinea;
each of these would have a +1D0 Availability Die in major cities, and
+1D6 elsewhere.

Table: Common Armor

| Armor Type        | Cost | Prowess  | Item Die          |
| :---------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------------- |
| Buckler           | 1D6  | Shield   | Block, Parry +1D8 |
| Leather jerkin    | 1D6  | Flexible | Block +1D6        |
| Steel breastplate | 1D8  | Rigid    | Block +1D10       |

  - **Buckler:** A buckler is a type of small shield commonly used in dueling, usually paired with a rapier or other sword. They're good at deflecting blows as well as setting up an opponent for a riposte.
  - **Leather jerkin:** One of the most commonly worn armors, leather jerkins are simply leather vests or jackets reinforced with cuir bouilli shoulders and chest plates. While some can be decorated with artistic designs (for twice the price), the leather material can't support the enchantments needed for charmweaving.
  - **Steel breastplate:** A hard, steel breastplate, also known as a cuirass, protects the vital organs of its wearer, with the exception of the head. As with most armor, you can't wear both a breastplate and an article of torso clothing, and the armor doesn't support charmweaving.

Some less common armors are shown below. Each has an Availability Die in
a city that equals its cost, and one or more steps higher in smaller
towns.

Table: Uncommon Armor

| Armor Type     | Cost | Prowess  | Item Die           |
| :------------- | :--: | :------: | :----------------- |

  - **Buff coat:** Essentially a longer, reinforced gambeson, buff coats are favored by military officers. As with gambesons, they have charmwoven enchants; they are Soldier (1D6) social rank, can take Military (Brawl, Aim, or Strategy) charms, and are available in the full range of colors used in charmweaving.

  - **Gambeson:** Thick cloth padding makes these jerkins equal to leather in protective value, but the slightly longer construction time means they see less use. However, they can have charmwoven enchants added.  Gambesons are considered to be Soldier (1D6) social rank, can have Defense (Block, Parry, or Dodge) charms added, and are only available in neutral colors.
  <a href="#charmweaving" class="xref-see-charmweaving"></a>
  - **Kite shield:** Also known as a heater shield, this is larger than a buckler. The size prevents you from effectively using any Main Hand weapon at the same time as the shield.
  - **Maille hauberk:** This is a jacket or vest made of chainmail. The protective benefits in modern Gallinea are outweighed by the time -- and thus the cost -- necessary to produce it.
  - **Morion:** This is an open-faced, steel helmet shaped somewhat like a hat with a ridge down the middle. Morions are favored by guards and infantry. While it gives minimal protection when used alone, it grants a +1D6 Bonus Die to Block rolls if you're wearing a steel breastplate. You can't wear an article of head attire while wearing a morion.
  - **Parade armor:** These are highly decorative suits of plate armor, each one individually made for its wearer. (They're only available in major cities, and even then usually have a +1D12 Availability Die.) Like other suits of plate armor, the wearer takes a Drop 2 penalty on Defense (Dodge), Dueling (Feint), and Nature (Prowl) rolls when parade armor is worn. 

    While the actual protective value of parade armor is less than a suit of plate armor, they are the only type of rigid armor that can take charms.  Parade armor is Noble (1D10) social rank and can be made in any color.  The helmet, breastplate, gauntlets, and boots can each have individual charms. 
  <a href="#charmweaving" class="xref-see-charmweaving"></a>

    Parade armor helmet charms can be Culture (Arts, Etiquette, Scholarship) or Observation (Perceive, Intuition, Deduce); breastplate charms can be Defense (Block, Parry, Dodge) or Interaction (Inspire, Negotiate, Deceive); gauntlet charms can be Military (Brawl, Aim, Strategy) or Streetwise (Banter, Carouse, Larceny); and boot charms can be Nature (Explore, Husbandry, Prowl) or Dueling (Lunge, Parry, Riposte). The entire suit of parade armor must be worn or none of the charms are active.

  - **Plate armor:** The knights of Varendia are famous for their heavy plate armor, which does provide superior protective ability albeit at the expense of mobility. While you are wearing plate armor, you take a Drop 2 penalty on Dodge, Feint, and Prowl rolls. In addition, you can't wear any additional articles of clothing save for shoulder items such as cloaks or tabards.
  - **Valmain-rivet:** Originally created in Varendia ("valmain" references an older Albian term meaning "Varendish"), these are cheap, easily constructed suits of partial plate armor used for equipping large armies. There's nothing glamorous about them; they're simply functional.  You can't wear torso, head, or arm clothing items while wearing valmain-rivet.

### Living Expenses

Characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are assumed to have their housing
and daily nutritional needs met by their Social Rank scores without
having to make Wealth rolls or spend Rewards for normal daily living.
Only unusual expenses, such as a night on the town or an inn stay in a
distant city, need to be paid for separately.

The costs below are fairly standardized across Gallinea, although it's
only the larger towns and cities that have the best food, inns, and
alcohol. As a package, one night's stay for a character and her horse in
an inn with an attached tavern will cost 4D0 for the cheapest room and
food, 3D6+1D0 for good quality, and 3D8+1D0 for the most exquisite food,
drink, and suite.

Characters who go carousing and buy rounds on the house can use the
price of the most expensive alcohol bought as an Item die on their
Streetwise (Carouse) rolls.

Table: Living Expenses

  - **Brandestoc (Ekalia):** This pole weapon can be mistaken for a
    quarterstaff at first glance, but when the wielder gives a sharp thrust,
    three blades emerge from the end. This is a Drop 2 action, and it gives
    the brandestoc the Reach quality until the end of the current scene.

    quarters favor this dueling dagger, which has a broad blade nearly equal
    to that of a sword.

    of Mathac heritage and is closely identified with Bear Island.

    but it's well-known that the swordcrafters of Ondala produce the finest
    rapiers in the world. Perfectly balanced, the espada ropera is desired
    by fencers across Elara.
    
  - **Hook Prosthesis (Ekalia):** *description needed*
    
  - **Jambiya (Northern Ifran):** This curved knife is a common tool across

    defenses.
    
  - **Katzbalger (Varendia):** This heavy Varendish long sword is designed
    for chopping -- arms, shields, legs, armor, whatever. When used with
    both hands, the Weapon Die increases to 1D10.
    
  - **Koncerz (Talania):** *description needed* sabre

## Crafting # {.breakbefore}

As described earlier, characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers* can use most specialties in order to craft items
related to that specialty. The requirements for crafting are:

  - **You need to spend time.** The time varies -- minutes, hours, days,
    weeks. You can't craft more than 8 hours in a day. (Lutetia's unions
    are quite strong.) You may be able to increase or decrease the time
    to craft an item, to affect your success at crafting.

  - **You need tools to work.** If you don't have the right tools, you
    at least need something that can function as the right tools, even
    if you don't get an Item Die from the makeshift tool.

  - **You need at least one specialty rank.** You can't make a crafting
    roll based on the skill alone. Each further specialty rank adds new
    items you can craft.

  - **You need to expend supplies.** Supplies are counted in "units", an
    abstracted measure of the raw material you have on hand. In most
    cases, you can't substitute something else, but check with your MJ.

  - **You need to make a specialty roll.** If you've met all the other
    requirements listed above, you automatically succeed on the roll and
    craft something. The purpose of the roll is to determine how well of
    a job you did on the crafting. The more success points you spend,
    the better the final product. You can't gain style points on
    crafting rolls.

### Supplies

The raw materials used in crafting are known as "supplies". Supplies are
measured in terms of "units" -- each unit of supplies is an abstract
amount of the materials for making the simplest item of a given type.

Supplies can be purchased as shown in the following table. All supplies
can be bought in bulk<a href="#making-a-wealth-roll" class="xref-asdesc-insection"></a>.

Table: Supplies

| Item                   | Cost | Use                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemical ingredients | 1D6  | Draughts, salves, concoctions, poison, medicine |
| Art media              | 1D6  | Works of art                                    |
| Blackpowder charges    | 1D0  | Blackpowder weapons, phlogistone components     |
| Clockwork gears        | 1D6  | Clockwork devices and components                |
| Crucible steel         | 1D6  | Weapons, armor, clockwork gears, casings        |
| Fabric                 | 1D0  | Charmweaving                                    |
| Foodstuffs             | 1D0  | Cooking, eating                                 |
| Medicine               | 1D6  | Surgery, treat                                  |
| Writing materials      | 1D0  | Reports, written works of art, battle plans     |

**Alchemical ingredients:** Chemicals, herbs, rare salts, parts of
animals, and other materials used to create salves, draughts, poison,
and medicine.

**Art media:** Supplies for creating works of art, ranging from canvas and paints to sculpturing clay and marble blocks.

**Blackpowder charges:** Units of blackpowder that can create explosive weapons or be purified to produce phlogistone.

**Clockwork gears:** The parts needed to create clockwork components that are then assembled into clockwork devices.

**Crucible steel:** Worked metal that can used to make weapons, armor, clockwork gears, and more.

**Fabric:** Cloth, lace, thread, silk, dyes, leather, buttons, and other materials for making clothing.

**Foodstuffs:** Grains, fruit, meat, cheeses, sugar, eggs, bread, and
other materials for cooking. One unit of uncrafted foodstuffs is enough
to feed one person for one day.

**Medicine:** Medicine, medicinal herbs, and other medical supplies used
to treat injuries, cure diseases, create antidotes, and perform surgery.

**Writing materials:** Paper and ink, used in creating reports, plans, and written works of art.

#### Scrounging

If you have neither the necessary supplies on hand nor the ability to
purchase more, you can spend your time scrounging -- looking in refuse
bins for art supplies, junk piles for crucible steel, discarded
trimmings for fabric, or roadkill and old fruit for foodstuffs. Every
two hours spent scrounging produces one unit of supplies -- as long as
your MJ agrees there are such supplies to be found. If you're lost in
the middle of a frozen tundra, you probably can't find blackpowder
charges just waiting for you to come along.

### Workrooms

Basic sets of handheld tools are described <a href="#tools-of-the-trade" class="xref-insection"></a>,
and can be used as an Item Die on appropriate crafting rolls.

However, most serious crafting work is done in some kind of dedicated
room or outbuilding. Such workrooms have everything you'd find in a set
of tools, plus additional equipment, furniture, and resources for each
task. These workrooms can provide an Item Die, as shown on the following
table. As you can only have one Item Die per dice pool, you can't
combine the Item Die from a set of tools with the Item Die from a
workroom.

Table: Workrooms

| Room            | Cost | Item Die |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- |
| Artist's Studio | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Kitchen         | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Laboratory      | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Library         | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Medical Theatre | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Observatory     | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Séance Room     | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Smithy          | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Workshop        | 2D10 | \+1D10   |

Most workrooms are only available in cities, although some smaller towns
might be able to provide an artist's studio, a kitchen, a séance room,
or a smithy. Setting up a workroom takes 8 hours of work, although that
can be done by either one person or divided among several.

Superior workrooms can be purchased for twice the listed cost and an
Item Die of one step higher. A superior kitchen costs 4D8 and gives a
+1D10 Item Die on rolls for cooking. Superior workrooms take 20 hours to
set up and can only be acquired in large cities.

### Success Limits

You must have at least one rank in a Specialty to be able to craft with that Specialty.
However, a single specialty rank limits the quality of the item to a
basic work. The more specialty ranks you have, the higher potential you
can create.

Each Specialty's crafting description details the success limits for
crafted items. The maximum values for Item Dice, Charm Dice, Bonus Dice,
and the Standard Opposition (for attempts to escape or undo your
creation) are shown in the following table. The applicable columns of
the table are repeated with each Specialty's crafting
description.

Table: Success Limits

| Specialty Rank | Item Die | Charm Die | Bonus Die | Standard Opposition   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| \+1            | \+1D6    | \+1D6     | \+1D0     | Easy (3D6)            |
| \+2            | \+1D8    | \+1D8     | \+1D6     | Moderate (3D8)        |
| \+3            | \+1D10   | \+1D10    | \+1D8     | Difficult (3D10)      |
| \+4            | \+1D12   | \+1D12    | \+1D10    | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| \+5            | \+1D12   | \+1D12    | \+1D12    | Very Difficult (3D12) |

### Tag Dice

<a href="#using-skills" class="xref-capital-asdesc-insection"></a> Tag Dice are a type
of Bonus Dice that are tied to a specific concept. This could be a
single word, an emotion, a Passion, a phrase, or other abstract
constructions. The crafting description for each Specialty describes how
each Tag is created, what you can associate each Tag with, and how you
can increase the Bonus Die size of the Tag.

For example, if you create a painting of Scanbreille Keep as seen from a
grassy meadow, you could assign a Tag of "Peaceful." The Tag Die starts
at +1D0, and for every 2 success points, you can increase the size of
that die. You can also use success points to add a different Tag, such
as "Loyalty." These additional dice also start at +1D0.

The Tag Die can be added to a dice pool as a Bonus Die whenever it makes
sense in the story -- so if you're trying to calm down a visiting
dignitary, you might seat her under the painting and add the Peaceful
tag to your Interaction (Negotiate) dice pool. Alternately, if you're
trying to inspire the soldiers of Scanbreille Keep to stand firm and not
desert in the face of the enemy, you may want to make your Interaction
(Inspire) roll when you stand in front of the painting of the iconic
castle.

### Extra Supplies

Sometimes you can spend more supplies than you need in order to craft a
superior item. You could create a larger or more ornate version of an
item, or perhaps simply make several prototypes before eventually
getting it right.

If the crafting Specialty has an "Extra Supplies" entry, you can use
more materials than needed while crafting to add a Bonus Die to your
dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in
the Specialty, as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Supplies

| Units of Supplies | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2                 | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 3                 | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 4                 | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 6                 | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 8                 | 1D12      | \+5                     |

### Extra Time

Taking your time to craft an item means you can check and re-check your
work at every step of the way, and the extra crafting time allows for
more careful work.

If the description of the crafting specialty has an "Extra Time" entry,
you can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die to your dice
pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in the
Specialty, as shown on the following tables:

Table: Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 15 minutes      | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 1 hour          | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 4 hours         | 1D12      | \+5                     |

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

Table: Extra Time for a One-Day Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 days            | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 5 days (1 week)   | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 10 days (2 weeks) | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 20 days (4 weeks) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 30 days (6 weeks) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

### Rushing

You don't always have the luxury of time when crafting. Perhaps there's
only 30 minutes until the brigands arrive and you still need to build
that net-flinging mechanical trap you've been planning out in your head.
In such a situation, you can rush your work to get it done in time.

If the crafting Specialty has a "Rushing" entry, you can reduce the time
to craft your creation by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You
can't rush a job that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop
penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting, as shown on the
following table:

Rushing also increases the opposition from an automatic success to Easy
(3D6). If you fail on a rushed crafting roll, you expend one unit of
resources as appropriate for your task

Table: Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

Table: Rushing a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 30 minutes      | Drop 1       |
| 15 minutes      | Drop 2       |
| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

Table: Rushing a One-Day Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 6 Hours         | Drop 1       |
| 4 Hours         | Drop 2       |
| 2 Hours         | Drop 3       |
| 1 Hour          | Drop 4       |

### Weapon Qualities

When you craft a weapon, it's assumed to be a "stock" version of that
weapon<a href="#weapons" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a>.  If you want to add
something extra to a crafted weapon, you can add a Weapon Quality to
that weapon. Each specialty's crafting description lists which qualities
can be given to each type of weapon. The maximum number of Weapon
Qualities you can add to any given weapon equals your rank in the
crafting Specialty.

Rather than repeating the descriptions of Weapon Qualities in each
crafting specialty, they're listed here for easy reference. You can't
add the same Weapon Quality twice to a single weapon.

  - **Cavalry:** A weapon with the Cavalry quality must be used with
    your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding a mount,
    you can substitute the mount's Item Die for your Weapon Die against
    an unmounted opponent.
  - **Defending:** You can use this weapon to make a Defense (Parry)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type
    of weapon usually can't be used for parrying.
  - **Double-Barreled:** You can fire twice, once per barrel, without
    reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the
    Weapon Die increases by one step, but you take a Drop 1 penalty
    because it's harder to aim. Reloading each barrel separately gives
    the normal Drop penalty for the unaltered weapon, and reloading both
    barrels is a Drop 4 combined action.
  - **Extended Long Range:** The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at Long
    range. This can only be applied to weapons which can't normally be
    used at Long range, but which can be used at Medium range.
  - **Extended Medium Range:** The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at
    Medium range. This can only be applied to weapons which can't
    normally be used at Medium range.
  - **High-Caliber:** Increase the Weapon Die by one step. The Drop
    penalty for reloading the weapon increases by 1, and the Drop
    penalty at Long range increases by 2.
  - **Lightened:** Decrease the Weapon Die by one step. If the unaltered
    weapon could be used in your main hand, you can now use it in
    either. If the weapon required two hands to use, it can now be used
    with just the main hand. You can't lighten a weapon that's been
    weighted.
  - **Point Blank:** Decrease the Drop Penalty for Close range by 2.
  - **Quickloading:** Decrease the Drop Penalty for reloading this
    weapon by 1.
  - **Reach:** The weapon can be used to attack into an adjacent area as
    well as your own.
  - **Responding:** The weapon can be used to make a Dueling (Riposte)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type
    of weapon usually can't be used for riposting.
  - **Rifled:** Reduce the Drop Penalty at Medium range by 1 and at Long
    range by 1.
  - **Sparring:** You can use this weapon to make a Military (Brawl)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though weapons
    usually can't be used with Brawl.
  - **Success Table: Specialty (Option)** You add an option
    for spending success points to a specific Success Table. The details
    for each option are described later in this section.
  - **Throwable:** You can throw this weapon at a target using the
    Military (Aim) skill and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even
    though this type of weapon usually can't be thrown. The weapon has
    no Drop penalty at Close range, Drop 1 at Short range, and Drop 3 at
    Medium range.
  - **Weighted:** Increase the Weapon Die by one step. If the weapon
    could be used in either hand, it now is only usable in your main
    hand. If the unaltered weapon required your main hand, it now
    requires both hands. You can't weight a weapon that's been
    lightened.

#### Success Table Options

The Success Table: *Specialty* quality adds additional options to the
indicated success table.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: success :::::::::::::::::::::::::::

| \++++                           |  Disarming                        |
| \+++++                          |  Weapon-Breaking                  |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Basket Hilt:** If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease her
die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she has
+1D6 Advantage. Weapons with this quality are designed for parrying.

**Disarming:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using
to attack you or the weapon she's using to Parry your attack. (This
can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to choose
if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area,
or in your hand if you have one free. Weapons with this quality are
designed for disarming opponents.

**Entangling:** You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon,
holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1 penalty
on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional Success Points you
spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.
Your opponent can escape by making a simple check against Standard
Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon attack.

**Retort:** You can make a Riposte attack. Weapons with this quality are
designed for parrying and allow a Riposte to be made for a lower cost
than usual.

**Tripping:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in an
adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result in
them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. Weapons with this
quality are designed to pull an opponent off her feet.

**Unhorse:** If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that mount
and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them falling or
otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your mount can make
a trample attack right now for free, if it has that quality. Standing up
is a Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3
penalty. Weapons with this quality are designed for dismounting
opponents.

**Weapon-Breaking:** You snap your target's blade or hilt. You can only
do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or if
you are performing a Parry yourself. Weapons with this quality are
designed for catching and destroying weapons.

**Wounding:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds
than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is dying. Weapons with
this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a lower cost than usual.

**Yielding:** Your opponent takes four Yield. If her Yield equals or
exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. Weapons with this quality
allow you to inflict Yield for a lower cost than usual.


### Repairs

If you can create something, you can repair it as well. A damaged object
gains Malfunctions in the same way that a person gains Wounds. In terms
of game rolls, the object has a certain Drop penalty applied whenever
it's used -- Drop 1 for each Malfunction -- or one of its functions
simply stops operating.

The time to repair an object depends on the time it would take to create
a new one of the same type, as shown on the following table.

Table: Repair Time

| Base Crafting Time | Repair Time |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1 minute           | 1 minute    |
| 1 hour             | 1 minute    |
| 1 day              | 1 hour      |

You can take extra time or rush the repair if you are able to do the
same when creating the item.

As with normal crafting rolls, you automatically succeed. Each success
point gained reduces the Drop penalty by one, or restores one function
to working order. For every complete set of three Malfunctions you
repair, you have to spend 1 unit of any type of supplies that would be
used to create such an item.

### Crafting Rolls

The following tables are sorted by Specialty name and describe what can be crafted with each Specialty.


### Aim

You can craft bows, muskets, and pistols using the Military (Aim) specialty.

**Prowess Required:** You can only create bows if you have Bow Prowess,
muskets if you have Musket Prowess, and pistols if you have Pistol
Prowess.

**Base Time:** Crafting a weapon takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your metalworking tools or smithy to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Supplies of crucible steel are required for creating weapons.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Craft Article of Clothing (1 unit of fabric):** You create a basic
article of clothing that is social rank Commoner (D0) or Soldier (D6).
If the social rank is Artisan (D8) or higher, you need to pay extra
success points to create it. If you spend one additional success
point, you can create an article of clothing that is social rank Artisan
(D8) or Noble (D10). If you have at least 4 ranks in Magicks (Weave),
you can spend one more success point to create an article of clothing
that is social rank Royal (D12).

**Add Charm to Clothing:** You add a charm to the article you created,
with a Charm Die of +1D6. The item must be in accordance with the
applicable Laws of Fashion, described <a href="#the-nine-laws-of-fashion" class="xref-inchapter-under"></a>.

**Increase Charm (1 unit of fabric):** The Charm Die of the article of
clothing improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of
specialty ranks you have in Magicks (Weave).

**Reduce Material Cost:** You reduce the overall cost of this Crafting
roll by one unit of fabric.

**Masterpiece\!:** You've created an amazing article of apparel that
draws everyone's eyes. The article's Charm Die is automatically
maximized when used in a dice pool.

## Specialty Equipment

*introduction needed*


### Alchemical Items

Characters with the Magicks (Brew) specialty can produce draughts, salves, and concoctions.

#### Concoctions

Concoctions are mixtures that can be prepared beforehand or activated on
the spot by an alchemist orother character with skill in Magicks (Brew).
Making a Brew roll to produce a concoction takes one turn, with Moderate
(3D8) standard opposition; successes are spent as shown on the table
below. Each concoction created requires the expenditure of one unit of Alchemical Supplies.

Table: Concoctions

| Concoction          | Effect Produced                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Firefly Glow        | Phosphorescent chemicals that glow for one hour per + spent. Can be applied to one item of pocket, handheld, or portable size. |
| Nauseating Smell    | A horrible odor fills one Area per + spent.                                                                                    |
| Neutralizing Agent  | Negate one persistent effect caused by any concoction per + spent.                                                             |
| Oil Slick           | Dodge rolls in an adjacent Area take a Drop penalty equal to the number of + spent.                                            |
| Photoreactive Flash | A flash of light that can be seen up to one league away for every + spent.                                                     |
| Smoke Cloud         | A cloud of harmless smoke that fills one Area per + spent.                                                                     |

#### Draughts

Imbibing a draught is a Drop 1 combined action if the item is in hand;
the effects last until the end of the scene. Draughts with increased
potency have a cost equal to the die value; e.g., a D10 Aggression
Draught has a cost of D10.

Draughts provide a Charm die bonus on a given specialty. Since you can
only include one Charm die in a given dice pool, a character can't
benefit from both the draught and a charmwoven item that affect the same
specialty, only one or the other.


Table: Draughts

| Item                     | Cost     | Affected Specialty       |
| :----------------------- | :------: | :----------------------- |
| Accuracy Draught         | D6, bulk | Military (Aim)           |

| Tactics Draught          | D6, bulk | Military (Strategy)      |
| Teetotaler's Tea         | D6, bulk | Streetwise (Carouse)     |

#### Salves

Salves, oils, and unguents are applied externally, usually to the hands, requiring one turn to
use. The effects last until the end of the scene. Salves with increased potency have a cost equal to the die value.

Table: Salves

| Item                  | Cost     | Function                                               |

| Silence Oil           | D6, bulk | Nature (Prowl)                                         |
| Weaver's Lotion       | D6, bulk | Magicks (Weave)                                        |


### Poisons

There are three types of standard poisons in general use: lethal poison,
impairing poison, and sleep poison. For general rules on how to use and
apply poison, see the Medicine (Poison) specialty in the Skills
document.

Poisons are created by expending Alchemical Supplies and making a
Medicine (Poison) roll. New characters who are provocateurs can choose
which poisons they wish to begin with.

Poison antidote is general-use and can be used against any type of
standard poison. It's ineffective against some exotic poisons, such as
yellow-bellied scorpion venom.

Table: Poisons

| Item              | Cost     | Function                    |
| :---------------- | :------: | :-------------------------- |
| Antidote          | D6, bulk | Expend 1 per use of Poison  |
| Poison, deadly    | D6, bulk | Expend 1 per use of Poison  |
| Poison, impairing | D6, bulk | Expend 1 per use of Poison  |
| Poison, sleep     | D6, bulk | Expend 1 per use of Poison  |

#### Deadly Poison 

::::: success ::::::::::::
|      |                 |
| :--: | :-------------- |
| +++: | Inflict 1 Wound |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes Wounds
equalling her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and from
one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and is
dying.

#### Impairing Poison

:::::::::::::: success ::::::::
|      |                      |
| :--: | :------------------- |
| +++: | Inflict Drop Penalty |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict Drop Penalty:** Your opponent gains a Drop penalty on all rolls
equal to one die for every three Success Points you spend, up to a
maximum of Drop 4. This impairment lasts for 1 hour.

#### Sleep Poison

:::::::: success :::::::::
|      |                 |
| :--: | :-------------- |
| +:   | Inflict 1 Yield |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every Success Point
you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield Limit, she
is Yielded Out.

### Charmweaving

"Clothes make the woman," or so the old Lutetian maxim claims. Certainly
this is true in Gallinea's capital city as well as the rest of Elara;
fashion is a tangible thing in Gallinea.

Charmweaving, which originated in Lutetia, is the practice of adding
specific dyes, trinkets, threads, and other magickal enhancements to
articles of clothing. These enhancements provide bonuses to specific
tasks.


#### The Nine Laws of Fashion

Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also
made according to exacting standards known as Gallinea's Nine Laws of
Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to
work at all\!

While these are known as "Gallinea's" Laws, that's not because they're
enforced by the Queen's decree or by some sort of "fashion police" that
stalks the streets of Lutetia. Instead, these are akin to natural Laws
that were first noticed and codified in Gallinea; they simply describe
how things are rather than how they should be.

The First is the simplest Law:

##### The First Law: The Law of Couture

*"One's clothes must fit properly."*

It seems obvious at first -- clothing is meant to be worn and to fit
properly\! But it's also the most important. If your clothes aren't
sized correctly for you, none of the charms will function. In addition,
each off-size article of clothing you wear adds a Drop 1 penalty to
combat actions if it's too large or too small.

To ensure your clothes are properly sized, you can't just buy your
clothes off the rack; the people of Gallinea are a diverse group when it
comes to body size, and there are no "standard sizes". Your clothes will
need to be either be created specifically for you, or altered by a
tailor. Only then can charms be effectively added to such apparel.

##### The Second Law: The Law of Attunement

*"Charms are unique to the wearer."*

You can't just pick up any random charmwoven item and put it on, even if
it fits you. The patterns, glyphs, and trinkets sewn into charmwoven
clothing have to be calibrated for each wearers. This is a pretty simple
process -- as long as the charmweaver knows your birth date, birth time,
and place of birth. It usually takes about an hour to attune or reattune
charms to any given person.

What if you don't know some or any of that information to tell your
charmweaver? There are two options.

First, your charmweaver can attempt to adjust the charms to you anyway,
through trial and error. This takes one hour per piece of information
about your birth that you're missing. At the end of that process, the
charmweaver makes a simple Magicks (Weave) roll with the opposition pool
based on how much they don't know, as shown on the following
table.

Table: Opposition Pool for Charm Attunement Rolls

| Die | Birth Date           | Birth Time          | Place of Birth           |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| D0  | Exact date           | Time, to the minute | City or village of birth |
| D6  | Year and month known | Time, to the hour   | Province of birth        |
| D8  | Month known          | Morning or Night    | Country of birth         |
| D10 | Year known           | \--                 | Continent of birth       |
| D12 | Nothing known        | Nothing known       | Nothing known            |

The dice pool is based on all of these factors -- so if you know the
exact date of your birth, that you know you were born in the morning,
and that you were born somewhere in Talania, that's an opposition pool
of 1D0+1D8+1D8, or 2D8. As it's a simple check, the charmweaver needs
just one success point to correctly attune the item. On a failed check,
the charmweaver needs to start over again to attune the item.

The second option involves the use of Magicks (Portents), and for this
reason many charmweavers either work with those who can read omens, or
can do so themselves. 

The opposition pool for the Portents roll is the same as the pool
calculated above for the trial-and-error method using the Magicks
(Weave) specialty, but this is a standard roll not a simple roll. It
takes one minute to perform this type of reading, the portent-reader
must see you the entire time, and you must be willing to have it done.
Each success point spent reveals either your birth date, your birth time
to the minute, or your city or village of birth.

##### The Third Law: The Law of Pertinence

*"The charm must correspond to the article."*

Simply stated, this means that a charm can only be applied to an item
that has some relationship to the type of enchantment desired.

For example, gloves for soldiers can be given charms that assist with
Dueling or Military (Aim), while gloves for craftsmen can be charmed for
Magicks, Medicine, or Science.

Pertinent skills for any given type of clothing are found later in this chapter
<a href="#creating-charmwoven-clothing" class="xref-insection"></a>,
which also summarizes which types of charms can be applied to which pieces of attire.

##### The Fourth Law: The Law of Dissonance

*"Dissonance limits the effectiveness of charms."*

*description of dissonance needed*

| Dissonance Level | Maximum Charm Die |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 0                | No limits         |

##### Head Apparel

Gallineans wear many different kinds of hats, with a type of headwear
available to every type of charm -- all the skills, with the exception
of Initiative. The types of hats available are shown in the following
table.

**Beret, Artisan's:** The simple woolen beret is common among crafters
in Gallinea. You can get a beret in many different colors, although
beret colors have extra significance within Lutetian society. Each craft
guild claims ownership of a particular, exacting shade of blue, green,
or red, and will object strenuously to anyone unaffiliated wearing
"their" colors. To those outside of the Lutetian guilds, the
distinctions between beret colors is almost entirely opaque.

**Capotain:** A capotain is a tall hat, usually flat on the top, with a
narrow brim. It originated in Albia and has since spread to Gallinea,
usually worn by the soldiery. Most capotains are black in color, and
many sport buckles in front -- although Albian purists claim that such a
frivolity is inauthentic and typical of Gallinea's love of decoration
for its own sake. 

**Cavalier Hat:** Made famous by the Queen's cavaliers but worn
throughout Gallinea, cavalier hats have a wide brim and are usually worn
with one side pinned up. A dyed ostrich feather is often added, both for
appearance's sake and to allow all-black hats to take a charm. Sometimes
these hats are colloquially referred to as neversettes.

**Goggles, Gearspring:** These goggles are created and used by
mechanicians as well as other crafters. Each set of goggles has two or
more pairs of lenses that can be swapped in as necessary -- functions
include magnification of small objects, telescopic sighting of distant
objects, filters for specific colors, or simple eye protection.
Gearspring goggles offer a +1D6 Item Die on Observation (Perception)
rolls.

**Hair Ribbons:** Magickally charmed hair ribbons are popular with the
upper classes and are woven into the hairstyles -- or wigs -- of any
gender of noble. Unless affixed to a wig (which must be one of the
neutral colors of argent, brunâtre, cendree, or sable), the ribbons
require anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to weave into hair,
or double that time if forced to don them without the help of a capable
household servant.

**Masque:** Not a bandanna clumsily worn by a common brigand to disguise
her identity, a masque actually does little to hide one's appearance.
Used by the nobility at their lavish parties, each is custom created to
reflect the wearer's persona and opinions of herself. Many masques only
encircle the eyes and the space between them, while others cover the
entire face. A Gallinean holiday called the Festival of Masques
celebrates freedoms, including sexual freedoms, and is a time when
nobles and non-nobles alike don masques to participate in the revelry.

**Plague Mask:** Part of a chirurgeon's standard surgical wear, a plague
mask is usually styled like a bird's long beak, although other examples
exist, such as long tusks or simply a cylinder. Goggles built into the
mask provide covering for the chirurgeon's eyes, while medicinal herbs
and complex filters in the "nose" cavity prevent infection of
air-carried diseases.

**Skullcap, Clerical:** Sometimes called calottes, these skullcaps are
associated with the Asrian religion and worn by its chaplains.
Lower-ranking priests of Eserre wear celeste, azure, vert, or brunâtre
skullcaps, while those higher in the order cover their skulls with
calottes of argent, carnation, or purpure. Only those clergy appointed
as Guardians of the Faith are allowed to wear Or skullcaps, with the
golden yellow color symbolizing their connection to the sun goddess. Lay
workers within the church are free to wear sable or cendree calottes
while performing church duties.

**Tricorne:** These felt hats have wide brims like cavalier hats, but
are pinned up on the sides and backs, forming them into triangular
shapes. In Gallinea and Albia it's traditional to wear the tricorne with
the single point facing forward, and in Ekalia and Dragosa to wear it
pointing back. Tricornes are most popular among sailors and members of
the military, with officers using them to display medals and other
symbols of rank.

##### Shoulder Apparel

Shoulder charms tend to be about skills that are flashy and
attention-getting, although a few have use in disguising or hiding the
wearer.

#### Clockwork Devices

Each device consists of the following:

- 1 Casing
- 1 or more Power Sources
- 1 or more Components

**Gear Space:** Each casing has a certain amount of gear space available,
depending upon its size. The power source and the components use up that
space once installed. A miniaturization component can be installed in a
casing to increase its effective gear space.

**Power:** Each power source delivers a set amount of power, dependent on
the type of power source and the method of producing that power. Each
component consumes a specified amount of power, and the power source's
output must be enough to cover the power used by the components. Power
is measured in power units.

**Complexity:** The complexity of a device is equal to the number of power
sources plus the number of components.

#### Constructing a Device

**Note: These rules are obsolute and this section needs to be rewritten to 
reflect the current crafting rules.**

There are five steps to creating a device:

1. Plan the Device
2. Purchase the Supplies
3. Build the Parts
4. Install the Parts
5. Complete the Device

##### Plan the Device

Before you start, you should plan out what you want your device to do.
Decide how large the device will be – the size of its casing. Determine
what capabilities it will have by the components you choose to install,
and make sure that you have a strong enough power source to provide
power to those components.

Once you have the device planned out, you can spend four hours to make a
Science (Calculus) roll to draft a set of plans for building the device.
This is optional, but is highly recommended as it gives you an
additional die to roll when installing parts in your device and
completing it. 

The difficulty of the Science (Calculus) roll to draw plans is
determined by the complexity of the device you are designing, as shown
on the table below. 

Table: Device Complexity

| Device Complexity | Standard Opposition   |
| :---------------: | :-------------------- |
| 2                 | Easy (3D6)            |
| 3 – 4             | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 5 – 8             | Hard (3D10)           |
| 9+                | Very Difficult (3D12) |

If you earn at least two success points on the Science (Calculus) roll,
you have successfully drawn plans that will give you (or anyone else who
follows them) a D6 bonus on rolls to install and complete the device.
For each additional two success points you spend, you can increase the
size of that die up to a maximum limited by your ranks in Science
(Calculus), as shown below.

Table: Maximum Die

| Calculus Ranks | Maximum Die |
| :------------: | :---------: |
| +1             | D6          |
| +2             | D8          |
| +3             | D10         |
| +4             | D12         |
| +5             | D12         |

**Prototype:** If you have an existing prototype for the device, either
created by yourself or by someone else, you gain a bonus D6 die on the
roll to draw plans. The prototype does not need to be currently
functional for you to gain this bonus.

##### Purchase the Supplies

There are three ways to acquire the parts needed for constructing a
device: build them yourself, buy them from another clockworker, or
salvage the parts from another device.

If you are going to build your own parts, you will need to buy gear
supplies. Make a Wealth roll against the cost and availability of gear
supplies – D8 for the cost, and D6 availability unless you are in a
large city (in which case the availability is D0). Each success point on
the Wealth roll enables you to buy one unit of gear supplies since they
are a bulk item.

If you are going to buy certain parts, you will also make a Wealth roll
based on the cost of the part (casing, power source, or component) that
you wish to purchase. The cost for each is listed in the descriptions of
each part later in this chapter. A casing has an availability of D0,
while power sources and components have an availability equal to the
highest die of their costs.

For details on salvaging parts and supplies, see the later section on
Salvage.

##### Build the Parts

You can save money by building your own casing, although this does
consume more time. A roll is not necessary, although you must have
competency in the Science (Clockworks) specialty to construct a usable
casing. See the later section on Constructing a Power Source for more
information.

Building a power source or a component requires a number of gear
supplies as shown on the table for that part, and at least four hours'
work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for
each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth
of gear supplies to create components or power sources. Multiple rolls
may be required to create all the parts needed for a complex device.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that you can spend on a single
part is limited to your number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). 

**Standard Opposition:** The difficulty for this roll is Easy (3D6) if you
are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not.

**Tools:**If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** The plans for the overall device do not apply on this roll.

**Prototype:** You gain no bonus for having a prototype of the device when
making this roll.

##### Install the Parts

Installing a power source or component in a casing requires a Science
(Clockworks) roll (or series of rolls). The difficulty is Easy (3D6) if
you are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not. Each roll takes
four hours, and each success point installs one power source or
component.

**Tools:** If you have clockworker's tools, you gain an item die (usually
D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus
instead.

**Plans:** If you have plans for the device, you gain a bonus die based on
the quality of the plans when making this roll.

**Prototype:** If you have a prototype of the device, you gain a bonus D6
die on this roll. The prototype does not need to be currently functional
for you to gain this bonus.

##### Complete the Device

Once all the components have been successfully installed, the device
needs to be completed. This requires no roll, but does require one hour
of work per point of complexity of the device. 

#### Casings

Casings are measured by their physical size, which determines the amount
of gear space within the casing.

**Purchasing a Casing:** Casings are either purchased at the cost shown
below or constructed by the clockworker for no cost. The availability of
a casing is always D0. Gear supplies cannot be spent on casing costs.

**Creating a Casing:** It takes one hour per point of Gear Space to create a
casing. No skill roll is required, but the clockworker must have at
least one rank in the Clockworks specialty.

**Casing Notation:** A casing is described by listing the size of the casing
followed by the gear space of that casing in parentheses. Examples:
pocket (space 1), person (space 8), building (space 64).

Table: Casings 

| Casing Size | Cost | Gear Space |
| :---------- | :--: | :--------: |
| Pocket      | D0   | 1          |
| Handheld    | D0   | 2          |
| Portable    | D6   | 4          |
| Person      | D6   | 8          |
| Carriage    | D8   | 16         |
| Room        | D10  | 32         |
| Building    | D12  | 64         |

###### Pocket Size

A pocket-sized device is easily concealed, requires only one hand to
operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing.
Examples include pocketwatches and wrist holsters.

###### Handheld Size

A handheld device requires usually requires one hand to operate and can
be carried on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Examples include
clockwork pistols and gearswords.

###### Portable Size

A portable device is one which requires two hands to carry and operate,
or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Most don't need to be
self-mobile. Examples include clockwork muskets and wing-gliders.

###### Person Size

An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue – can't be
easily carried by a single person without requiring her full attention.
Most are therefore either stationary devices or self-mobile. Examples
include humanoid automata and velocipedes.

###### Carriage Size

Larger than a human but smaller than a room, carriage-sized devices are
on the scale of large pieces of furniture. Unless self-mobile, they
require several people in order to transport. Examples include clockwork
carriages and some industrial machines.

###### Room Size

Room-sized devices take up the entire space of a sizable room, and are
therefore rarely portable unless self-mobile. Examples include some
analytical engines and most watermills.

###### Building Size

Devices the size of a building are usually as large as a two or three
story building with a half-dozen rooms. Examples include airships and
clock towers.

#### Power Sources

Power sources are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing,
by how much power they can provide, and by how that power is activated
to enable components.

**Purchasing a Power Source:** A power source can be purchased,
pre-assembled, for the cost shown on the table for that power source.
The availability is equal to the highest cost die of the power source.

**Constructing a Power Source:** Unless otherwise specified, a power source
can be constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear
supplies as shown on the table for that power source, and at least four
hours' work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll
and for each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's
worth of gear supplies.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a
single power source is limited to her number of specialty ranks in
Science (Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with Science
(Clockworks) +3 can only spend 3 gears on creating a mainspring power
source.

*Note:* There are a few power sources that cannot be constructed using the
Clockworks specialty. This will be noted in the description of the power
source along with information about the required skill for construction.
The roll is otherwise treated like the Clockworks specialty roll.

**Power Source Notation:** A power source is described by listing the name
of the power source followed by the space, power supply, other qualities
of the power source, and the duration. Examples: gear train (space 1,
power supply 2, Drop 1, one action); mainspring (space 4, power supply
4, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes); tension trigger (space 1, power
supply 2, reset Drop 2, one use). 

###### Alchemical Capacitor

An alchemical capacitor is a simple jar device that is used to generate,
capture, and store electrical energy through alchemical means. A crude
electromechanical interface allows the energy of the capacitor to be
released and used over an extended period of time.

Each alchemical capacitor functions for 24 hours before needing to be
replaced and reinstalled in a device. The power supply's duration is the
same if it is used once during that time period or used repeatedly.

**Creating an Alchemical Capacitor:** The Magicks (Brew) specialty is
required to create an alchemical capacitor, and it requires the use of
alchemical supplies to do so. The maximum number of alchemical supplies
that can be spent to create an alchemical capacitor is equal to the
brewer's ranks in Magicks (Brew).

Table: Alchemical Capacitor Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power Supplied | Duration |
| :---: | :--- | :-------------------: | :------------: | :------: |
| 2     | D6   | 1 alchemical supplies | 1              | 24 Hours |
| 4     | D8   | 2 alchemical supplies | 2              | 24 Hours |
| 8     | D10  | 3 alchemical supplies | 3              | 24 Hours |
| 16    | D12  | 4 alchemical supplies | 4              | 24 Hours |

###### Gear Train

A gear train is used to transmit mechanical energy to a device as part
of the same action that uses the device; this mechanical energy is
supplied by the muscular activity of the device's user. This activity is
a combined action that imposes a Drop 4 to Drop 0 penalty on that
action. The power thus supplied is only good for that specific action.

For example, a velocipede might have a Drop1 penalty required to provide
3 units of power, which can then be used to power the carry and movement
components of the velocipede. This imposes that Drop 1 penalty on
actions undertaken by the rider of the velocipede during the turn in
which it's ridden.

**Variable Gear Train:** The power units and the drop penalty of any given
gear train are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A gear train
(space 0, power supply 2, Drop 2) will always supply 2 power units and
require a Drop 2 penalty to operate. However, a gear train can be made
variable by increasing the space by 1 and the cost by D6 (1 gear); this
allows variable power supply based on the amount of Drop penalty taken
to power it. For example, a variable gear train (space 0+1, power supply
1/2/3, Drop 1/2/4) supplies 1 power unit if a Drop 1 penalty is applied,
2 power units for a Drop 2 penalty, and 3 power units for a Drop 4
penalty.

Table: Gear Train Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies   | Power Supplied | Drop   | Duration   |
| :---: | :--: | :--------: | :------------: | :----: | :--------: | 
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 1              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 2              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears    | 1              | Drop 4 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 1              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 2              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 3              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear     | 4              | Drop 4 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 2              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 3              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears    | 4              | Drop 2 | One Action |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears    | 3              | Drop 0 | One Action |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears    | 4              | Drop 1 | One Action |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears    | 4              | Drop 0 | One Action |

###### Blackpowder Flintlock

A blackpowder flintlock is a kind of trigger that fires off once, using
exploding blackpowder to provide energy to power the device's
components. After the blackpowder flintlock is triggered, it must be
reloaded with blackpowder and reset – a procedure which takes an amount
of time as shown on the table below.

Creating a Blackpowder Flintlock: The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create a blackpowder flintlock, and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a blackpowder flintlock is equal to the
powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Blackpowder Flintlock Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power Supplied | Reset   | Duration |
| :---: | :--: | :-------------------: | :------------: | :----:  | :------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 blackpowder charges | 2              | Drop 1  | One use  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 blackpowder charge  | 4              | Drop 2  | One use  |
| 2     | D8   | 2 blackpowder charges | 6              | Drop 4  | One use  |
| 3     | D10  | 3 blackpowder charges | 8              | 2 Turns | One use  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 blackpowder charges | 10             | 3 Turns | One use  |

###### Mainspring

A mainspring is a complex clockwork spring used to store power until it
needs to be released. The initial power is put into the mainspring by
winding it and then is released by a mechanical flywheel.

The capabilities of a mainspring are measured in both how much power is
provided and how that power is stored and released; each factor is
purchased separately as shown on the tables below. To design a
mainspring, you need to determine both the power output and the duration
separately, paying the cost (in wealth rolls or gear supplies) for each.

A mainspring can't be wound for more than 10 minutes; at that point, the
mainspring is holding the full amount of power that it is able to store
and release.

**One Turn Winding/One Use per Success Point Duration:** If the winding time
is one turn and the duration is one use per success point, make a
Science (Clockworks) check against Easy (3D6) standard difficulty. Each
success point grants one use of the device before the end of the scene.

**Variable Mainspring:** The winding time and duration any given mainspring
are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A mainspring (space 1,
power supply 1, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes) will always require
1 minute of winding and provide 10 minutes of power. However, a
mainspring can be made variable by increasing the space by 1 and the
cost by D6 (1 gear); this allows variable duration based on the amount
of time spent winding it. For example, a variable mainspring (space 1+1,
power supply 1, wind 1 turn/1 minute/10 minutes, duration 1 minute/10
minutes/1 hour) supplies power for 1 minute if wound for 1 turn, 10
minutes if wound for 1 minute, and 1 hour if wound for 10 minutes.

Table: Mainspring  Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1              |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 2              |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 4              |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 6              |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 8              |

Table: Mainspring Options Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Wind       | Duration                   |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :--------- | :------------------------- |
| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | 1 Turn     | One use per success point  |
| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | 1 minute   | 1 minute                   |
| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | 10 minutes | 10 minutes                 |
| +0    | D6   | 1 gear   | 1 Turn     | 1 minute                   |
| +0    | D6   | 1 gear   | 1 minute   | 10 minutes                 |
| +0    | D6   | 1 gear   | 10 minutes | 1 hour                     |
| +0    | D8   | 2 gears  | 1 Turn     | 10 minutes                 |
| +0    | D8   | 2 gears  | 1 minute   | 1 hour                     |
| +0    | D8   | 2 gears  | 10 minutes | 24 hours                   |
| +0    | D10  | 3 gears  | 1 minute   | 24 hours                   |

###### Naturalistic Turbine

A naturalistic turbine is one that is hooked up to a source of power
that exists in the natural world – running water, winds, or tidal flow.
Naturalistic turbines produce a steady but low amount of power, without
requiring any special actions or fuel to make them function. Setting up
a naturalistic turbine to use any given natural energy supply requires
one hour per power unit produced, so most are installed in permanent
locations such as windmills or watermills.

**Natural Limits:** A stream can produce up to 2 power units, while larger
rivers can supply up to 4. Wind power varies between 0 and 3 power units
in most situations. Tidal flow usually only can provide 1 power unit.

**Sails:** A sail takes up half the space of a normal naturalistic turbine,
but the power supplied can only be used for movement. It also requires
the purchase of one unit of fabric supplies per power unit.

Table: Naturalistic Turbine Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1              |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2              |
| 6     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3              |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4              |

###### Phlogistone Furnace

A phlogistone furnace burns the rare mineral phlogistone to use for
generating lift and propulsion. It is primarily used in airships and can
be prohibitively expensive for other uses.

**Limited Power:** Power units produced by a phlogistone furnace can only be
used to power carry and movement components.

**Envelope:** A charmwoven cloth envelope is necessary for use with a
phlogistone furnace; this requires the skills of a charmweaver with at
least 4 specialty ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Fuel:** Each hour that a phlogistone furnace is in use, it burns one pound
of phlogistone per power unit supplied. The amount of power supplied can
be reduced by burning lesser quantities of phlogistone.

**Creating a Phlogistone Furnace:** The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create a phlogistone furnace, and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a phlogistone furnace is equal to the powderworker's
ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Phlogistone Furnace Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied              | Envelope Cost | Envelope Supplies |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :-------------------------- | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 10 (carry or movement only) | D10           | 4 fabric          |
| 6     | 2D12 | 5 gears  | 20 (carry or movement only) | D12           | 5 fabric          |

###### Tension Trigger

A tension trigger stores energy for use and then releases it. To reset a
tension trigger, you need to take a reset action, which is a combined
action with a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4. Unlike gear trains, tension
triggers store energy for future use rather than immediate use, but
unlike mainsprings a tension trigger will only store that energy for a
single use.

Table: Tension Trigger Power Source

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power Supplied | Reset  | Duration |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :------------: | :----: | :------- |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1              | Drop 4 | One use  |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 2              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 3              | Drop 4 | One use  |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2              | Drop 1 | One use  |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3              | Drop 2 | One use  |
| 1     | D12  | 4 gears  | 3              | Drop 1 | One use  |

#### Components

Components provide the basic functionality of a clockwork device, and
are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing, by how much
power require to run, and by the effects the component can produce.

**Purchasing a Component:** A component can be purchased, pre-assembled, for
the cost shown on the table for that component type. The availability is
equal to the highest cost die of the component.

**Constructing a Component:** Unless otherwise specified, a component can be
constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear supplies as
shown on the table for that component, and at least four hours' work. At
the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each
success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point's worth of
gear supplies to construct components or power sources.

**Skill Limit:** The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a
component is limited to her number of specialty ranks in Science
(Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with +3 Science (Clockworks)
can only spend 3 gears on creating a movement component.

**Component Notation:** A power source is described by listing the name of
the power source followed by the space, power requirements, and other
qualities of the component. Examples: articulation (space 1, power 0,
Drop 1); carry (space 2, power 1, person); projectile weapon (space 3,
power 1, weapon die d8, close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 0, long
Drop 2).

###### Armor

Armor plating protects both the device itself and anyone using or within
the device. The armor component grants an Armor Die that can be used for
Defense (Block) rolls.

Table: Armor Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Armor Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D0        |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | D6        |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | D8        |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | D10       |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | D12       |

###### Articulation

Clockwork devices are inherently clumsy; if used as replacements for a
human's natural ability, they take a Drop 4 penalty on associated
actions. This is primarily the case when someone replaces part of her
body with a clockwork limb, such as an arm or a leg. The articulation
component reduces those penalties from Drop 4 down to Drop 2, Drop 1 or
Drop 0.

**Creating an Articulation Component:** The Medicine (Surgery) specialty is
required to create an articulation component with a low Drop penalty.
Surgery +1 is required for Drop 1, and Surgery +2 for Drop 0.

Table: Articulation Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Penalty  |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 4   |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 2   |
| 2     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 1   |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | Drop 2   |

| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | Drop 0   |
| 0     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | Drop 1   |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | Drop 0   |
| 0     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | Drop 0   |

###### Calculation

The calculation component gives the device the ability to compute
certain values when given appropriate information. The simplest form of
calculation is simple timekeeping; nearly any clockwork device can be
made to function as a clock.

More advanced calculations can compute the calendar date (including holy
days and stellar phenomenon), plot out a navigation course, do complex
polynomial math such as ballistics, or even do relatively complex
analytical analysis.

Unless the device has the measurement component, it is reliant upon user
input for all appropriate information, such as the longitude and
latitude, the weather conditions, and so on. Faulty data can lead to
faulty calculations.

**Creating a Calculation Component:** The Science (Calculus) specialty is
required to create a calculation component and it requires the use of
clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can
be spent to create a calculation component is equal to the creator's
ranks in Science (Calculus).

Table: Calculation Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Calculation Complexity |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------------------- |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Timekeeping            |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Calendar               |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | Navigation             |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 1     | Polynomials            |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 1     | Analytics              |

###### Carry

The carry component gives a device the ability to lift additional
weight. Most devices with the movement component have enough carrying
capacity to lift themselves, including a normal load; some have even
greater capacity depending on their use.

Table: Carry Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Carrying Capacity |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :---------------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Pocket            |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Handheld          |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Portable          |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Person            |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | Carriage          |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 4     | Room              |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 8     | Building          |

###### Delay Timer

A delay timer prevents a power source from providing power to a device
until a fixed amount of time has passed. To use the delay trigger
component, first it must be armed and the length of delay set. The delay
durations shown are not randomly determined but are set by the user,
although each with a set range has a minimum of one time unit.

Delay timers are most frequently used with blackpowder flintlock or
tension trigger power sources, and often trigger projectile weapon traps
or bombs.

Table: Delay Timer Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Arm      | Delay Duration        |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------- | :-------------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | Drop 2   | End of current action |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 1 Turn   | 1-10 Turns            |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 1 Turn   | 1-10 Minutes          |
| 1     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 1 minute | 1-8 Hours             |
| 1     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 1 minute | 1-6 Days              |

###### Efficiency

The efficiency component reduces the time necessary to do a simple,
repetitive task. For combined actions, this reduces the Drop penalty by
1, 2 or 4 – but with a minimum of Drop 1. For other repetitive tasks
this reduces the time needed to complete those tasks, through mechanical
automation. For example, a mechanized loom could cut in half the time
needed to produce simple cloth.

An efficiency component cannot reduce the time of complex tasks that
involve specialty rolls, such as charmweaving or surgery.

Table: Efficiency Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Drop Reduction   | Time Reduction     |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 1 | Reduce Time by 10% |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | Reduce Drop by 2 | Reduce Time by 25% | 
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | Reduce Drop by 4 | Reduce Time by 50% |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | --               | Reduce Time by 75% |
| 16    | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | --               | Reduce Time by 90% |

###### Explosion

This component produces a loud and potentially deadly explosion. It's
used in creating bombs or grenades.

**Power Requirement:** An explosion component can only be powered by a
blackpowder flintlock or an alchemical capacitor. Note that blackpowder
flintlocks are a lot more effective at powering an explosion than an
alchemical capacitor.

**Environmental Damage:** An explosion does damage to everything inside a
given area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent areas,
and even targets up to 2 areas away for the most powerful explosions.
This environmental damage inflicts one yield for one success point, and
one wound for three success points.

**Self-Destruction:** Upon use, the device is destroyed by the force of its
own explosion.

**Creating an Explosion Component:** The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is
required to create an explosion component and it requires the use of
blackpowder supplies to do so. The maximum number of blackpowder
supplies that can be spent to create an explosion component is equal to
the powderworker's ranks in Science (Blackpowder).

Table: Explosion Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies              | Power | Environmental Damage (1 area, 2 areas) |
| :---: | :--: | :-------------------: | :---: | :------------------------------------- |
| 1     | D0   | 1 blackpowder charge  | 2     | 3D6                                    |
| 1     | D6   | 2 blackpowder charges | 4     | 3D8                                    |
| 2     | D8   | 3 blackpowder charges | 6     | 3D10 (3D6)                             |
| 4     | D10  | 4 blackpowder charges | 8     | 3D12 (3D8)                             |
| 8     | D12  | 5 blackpowder charges | 10    | 5D12 (3D10, 3D6)                       |

###### Hand-to-Hand Weapon

The Hand-to-Hand Weapon component gives a device the ability to be used
as a weapon by granting it a Weapon Die, and assigning it a Weapon
Prowess category. Choose one option from each of the following tables to
define a complete Hand-to-Hand Weapon.

**Size Limit:** A device with the hand-to-hand weapon component can be no
larger than Portable size.

Table: Hand-to-Hand Weapon Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Weapon Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D6         |

| +0    | D0   | 0 gears  | +0    | Portable    | Pike           | 1D12           |

###### Injector

The injector component gives a device the ability to inject a fluid,
such as an alchemical solution or a vial of poison, into a living
creature. A device can hold only one dose and it takes a Drop 4 action
to refill the device.

Using the device in a combat situation requires a Medicine (Poisons)
roll to deliver its payload.

Table: Injector Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     |

###### Item Die

The item die component allows you to add an Item Die for one specialty
to a device. For example, a spyglass could provide an Item Die on
Observation (Perceive) rolls, or a tricked-out screwdriver could provide
an Item Die on Science (Clockwork) rolls.

To provide a bonus to more than one specialty, add another Item Die
component for each additional specialty.

**Defense (Parry), Dueling:** Use the Hand-to-Hand Weapon component to add a
melee Weapon Die to a device.

**Defense (Block):** Use the Armor component to add an Armor Die to a device.

**Initiative:** These specialties can never benefit from an Item Die.

**Military (Aim):** Use the Projectile Weapon component to add a ranged Weapon Die to a device.

Table: Item Die Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Item Die |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :------: |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | D6       |
| 2     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | D8       |
| 4     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | D10      |
| 8     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | D12      |

###### Magazine

A magazine component holds multiple shots of ammunition (bullets and
powder or quarrels, for example) for a device with the projectile weapon
component. The amount held in each magazine, and the time required to
reload the device with a full magazine, are shown in the table below.

Table: Magazine Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Shots | Reload    |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :---: | :-------- |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | 2     | Drop 4    |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 4     | Drop 4    |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 8     | 2 Turns   |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 16    | 3 Turns   |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 32    | 4 Turns   |

###### Measurement

The measurement component allows a device to take a reading of the
physical environment around it. By default, this is displayed on the
device in some way. Examples of qualities that can be measured include
the temperature, barometric pressure, altitude, longitude and latitude,
velocity, oceanic depth, compass directions, sound levels, and more. A
worn device could measure the wearer's speed, heart rate, or blood
pressure.

A measurement component is often tied to a calculation component to
allow the device to process the information that it measures.

Table: Measurement Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Qualities Measured |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :----------------: | 
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 1     | 1                  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | 1                  |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | 2                  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | 2                  |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | 4                  |
| 2     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | 4                  |
| 2     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | 8                  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | 8                  |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | 16                 |

###### Miniaturization

The miniaturization component doesn't actually add any capabilities to a
device, but it makes it easier to fit more into the casing of the
device. The component makes space in the device by reducing the size of
existing components; this is reflected by additional gear space that is
added to that of the casing.

**Unique Component:** A device can have only one miniaturization component.

Table: Miniaturization Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Additional Gear Space |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-------------------: |
| 0     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | +1                    |
| 0     | D6   | 1 gear   | 0     | +2                    |
| 0     | D8   | 2 gears  | 0     | +4                    |
| 0     | D10  | 3 gears  | 0     | +6                    |
| 0     | D12  | 4 gears  | 0     | +8                    |

###### Movement

The movement component gives the device the ability to move itself.

**Carry Component Required:** A device with a movement component must have a carry component of at least the same size as the device's casing.

**Roll:** The device moves at half speed when not on a road or other flat surface.

**Climb:** The device can move up and down vertically.

**Step:** The device can walk like a human or animal.

**Glide:** The device must maintain at least Walk speed in order to stay aloft.

**Float:** The device is a boat or ship and can travel on the surface of the water.

**Submerge:** In addition to being able to float on the surface of the water, the device can go beneath the waves like a submersible. 

**Fly:** The device can fly through the air. Unless it is powered by a Phlogistone Furnace, the device must maintain a minimum of Walk speed in order to stay aloft.

Table: Movement Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Walk    | Run     | Overland Speed      |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :-----: | :-----: | :------------------ |
| 1     | D0   | 0 gears  | 0     | 0 Areas | 1 Area  | 1 league per hour   |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | 1 Area  | 2 Areas | 3 leagues per hour  |
| 2     | D8   | 2 gears  | 2     | 1 Area  | 3 Areas | 6 leagues per hour  |
| 4     | D10  | 3 gears  | 3     | 1 Area  | 4 Areas | 10 leagues per hour |
| 8     | D12  | 4 gears  | 4     | 1 Area  | 5 Areas | 15 leagues per hour |

| +8    | D6   | 1 gear   | +3    | Fly           | 5 Areas         |

###### Powered Weapon

A powered weapon is a melee weapon that has been modified with moving
parts to make it even more deadly – for example, a rotating flail or a
chain-toothed sword. The powered weapon component grants a bonus die
that can be used whenever the device's Weapon Die is used, including
Defense (Parry) rolls and Dueling rolls.

**Size Limit:** A device with the powered weapon component can be no larger
than Portable size.

**Requires Hand-to-Hand Weapon:** You can only add this component to a
device if it already possesses the hand-to-hand weapon component. The
powered weapon Bonus Die cannot exceed the Weapon Die of the device.

Table: Powered Weapon Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Bonus Die  |
| :---: | ;--: | :------: | :---: | :--------: |
| 1     | D6   | 1 gear   | 1     | D6         |
| 1     | D8   | 2 gears  | 1     | D8         |
| 2     | D10  | 3 gears  | 2     | D10        |
| 4     | D12  | 4 gears  | 3     | D12        |

###### Projectile Weapon

A projectile weapon component fires a bullet, dart, arrow, quarrel,
cannonball, or other projectile at a target. Most devices use the
Military (Aim) specialty to attack, and gain a Weapon Die when doing so.
As with other missile weapons in The Queen's Cavaliers, it's not
necessary to track ammunition carried, but it is necessary to know
whether or not the weapon is loaded.

In addition to selecting the Weapon Die, reload time, and range
modifiers for the weapon, the designer also specifies which Weapon
prowess is used with the weapon. Devices which require the Cannon weapon
prowess use the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks instead of
Military (Aim). 

**Magazine:** A projectile weapon can optionally be fitted with a magazine
component to increase the number of times it can be fired without
reloading. In such a situation, the projectile weapon component loses
its reload quality and uses the reload time of the magazine instead.

**Size Limit:** A device with the projectile weapon component can be no
larger than Carriage size. (For cannons on larger buildings or ships,
just place the cannons as separate devices.)

**Ranges:** The range of a projectile weapon component is determined by
adding together a composite of all chosen range lines. Lines cannot be
combined if they both contain a value for the same range. All ranges
must be filled in with a Drop penalty or N/A.

The default ranges for a weapon with no extra space, cost, or power
requirements are: close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 1, long N/A.

Table: Projectile Weapon Component

| Space | Cost | Supplies | Power | Weapon Die | Reload |
| :---: | :--: | :------: | :---: | :--------: | :----: |

## Additional Rules # {.breakbefore}


### Combat # 

Combat is initiated when either party wants to begin a physical conflict. 

#### Actions Before Combat

Before combat actually begins, depending on the circumstances, a
character may able to take certain actions to gain benefits in the
upcoming fight.

These actions can include drawing weapons, drinking alchemical draughts,
shouting for help, and so on.

The only dice actions a character can take are those which will give the
character Advantage in the combat – such as a Prowl roll or a Strategy
roll. All Success Points from such rolls can only be spent on Advantage,
and only one roll of a given type can be made. Success Points from these
rolls cannot be spent on gaining Style Points. 
<a href="#advantage" class="xref-capital-seesection"></a> for more about
advantage.

##### Surprise

The MJ can decide that one side is surprised or otherwise unprepared for
a fight. An Observation roll can be used for this purpose, or the MJ can
simply rule based on the narrative.

If a character is surprised, she is unable to take any preparatory
actions before the fight, so cannot gain Advantage or prepare weapons
before the fight. In addition, she gains a Drop 1 penalty on Initiative
rolls (see below).

#### Rolling Initiative

At the start of combat, all combatants make an Initiative roll to
determine the order in which each one will act. There are three
Specialties under the Initiative skill, and the player (or MJ, for NPCs)
can choose which one to use: Impulse, Vigilance, or Timing. This is a
normal Skill roll, where the top two dice are added together for a
total, and the lower of those two dice is the potential number of
successes.

Initiative rolls are automatic successes, which means that there are no
opposition dice and the Success Points are counted as if the roll had
succeeded. Success Points from an Initiative roll are called Initiative
Points and can be spent during the course of the combat as described
below.

Once all combatants have made an Initiative roll, the MJ orders the
results based first on the total roll, and the number of successes to
break ties. If two characters roll the same total and number of
successes, then roll off using 1D10 until the tie is broken.

When each character's turn comes up in the Initiative order, she can
take one action, and then the turn passes to the next player in order.
When all characters have taken a turn, the round ends and starts again
with the first player in Initiative order.

If a new combatant enters a fight already in progress, she rolls
Initiative and is added into the Initiative order at the appropriate
place in the next round.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Identical NPCs

When Rabble or Stock Characters are used in quantities of more than two, the MJ can
group them together with one Initiative roll. All combatants in the
group will take their actions at the same place in the Initiative
sequence. Any Initiative Points spent apply to only one of such grouped
characters at a given time.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Spending Initiative Points

There are three ways to use Initiative Points during the course of a
combat scene:

- Seize the Initiative
- Interpose
- Reprise Attack

Each has a cost that varies depending on the Specialty used for the
Initiative roll – for example, if a character used Impulse, it would
cost her one Initiative Point to Seize the Initiative, two points to
Interpose, and three points to Reprise Attack.

**Seize the Initiative:** For one round, the character jumps ahead in the
Initiative order, before someone else is about to act. The next round,
the character acts at her normal place in the Initiative order.

**Interpose:** For one attack, the character makes herself the target of
someone else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This
can be used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined
action with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately,
an Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. A character can Interpose only once per round.

**Reprise Attack:** If the character failed on an attack roll, she can
repeat the attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. A
character can Reprise Attack only once per round.

#### Areas and Positioning

Positioning and movement in *The Queen's Cavaliers* are represented by Areas; each Area is a
distinct location where characters might find themselves, as determined
by the MJ.

Before a fight breaks out, the MJ should define these Areas and the
interrelations between them. For example, if one Area is a dock, another
Area might be the deck of a ship. The MJ could say that travel is
possible from the dock to the deck by both the gangplank and the ropes
tying the ship to the dock.

Areas are usually represented by 3x5 index cards or by drawing
rectangles on a piece of paper. Tokens, miniatures, or other small
objects can be used to represent the locations of each combatant, and
moved from Area to Area as the combat progresses.

An example of the Areas for a complex fight is shown above as it may be
laid out with 3x5 cards; in addition, lines are given to show the usual
ways in which a character could move from one Area to another.

What if a character in the Crow's Nest wants to dive off into the water,
or land on the docks? The MJ can judge these exceptions on a
case-by-case basis, generally erring on the side of allowing characters
to move around relatively freely.

But what if someone wants to enter the captain's quarters? That room
isn't shown in the original setup – but if it makes sense to exist,
based on the fictional circumstances of the game, the MJ can add an
additional rectangle or index card to represent this new Area on the
fly, and point out how it can be entered or left.

The primary way to move between Areas is by using the Move action,
either by itself in a turn or as a combined action (see below for
details).

#### Actions in Combat

Each time a combatant's turn comes up in the Initiative order, she can
take up to one action. An action involves making an opposed dice roll of
some kind, such as an attack or using a skill, or making another action
that affects the shared fictional world such as moving.

The list of actions that can be taken includes:

- Attack a Foe
- Assist a Friend
- Flourish to Gain Style
- Focus to Reroll Initiative
- Movement
- Prepare an Action
- Reload your Weapon
- Use a Skill

Minor actions are possible, such as drawing a weapon, mounting a horse,
or opening a door. Most of those can simply be done as a combined action
(see below), although you could also do that on your turn as your entire
turn.

##### Combined Actions

Many actions can be combined together with other actions. These actions
don't require a dice roll, but instead impose a Drop Penalty on the
primary action's roll.

For example, if you wish to draw your weapon, you could take an action
to do that. Or you could combine drawing the weapon with making an
attack with it.

“Draw a weapon” is a Drop 1 combined action. This means you'd take a
Drop 1 penalty on whatever roll you choose to make that turn as your
action.

Drop Penalties for combined actions are cumulative; if you move to an
adjacent area (another Drop 1 penalty) along with drawing your weapon,
you now have a Drop 2 penalty on your attack.

A partial list of combined actions is shown below:

- **Drop 0:** Drop Weapon
- **Drop 1:** Move, Stand Up, Dismount, Draw Weapon, Sheathe Weapon, Switch Hands, Imbibe Draught, Arm Grenade
- **Drop 2:** Run, Retrieve Weapon, Improvise Weapon, Mount Horse, Reload (Pistol), Reload (Crossbow)
- **Drop 3:** Reload (Musket)

If a desired combined action isn't listed, the MJ can assign an appropriate Drop Penalty based on the examples listed above.

You can never combine two or more actions that require a dice roll, such as two attacks.

If you choose to not take an action that requires a dice roll, you can
instead take multiple combined actions, up to a total of Drop 4. For
example, reloading a pistol (Drop 2), dismounting (Drop 1), and moving
(Drop 1). You wouldn't be able to also drink a draught in the same turn,
because that would impose a Drop 5 penalty. (This limit only applies to
Drop Penalties resulting from combined actions, and not from Wounds.)

##### List of Actions

The following actions require the use of your action during a turn, although some can be used as combined actions where noted.

###### Attack

Your character makes an attack against a target, using a Dueling skill
(Lunge or Feint) or a Military Skill (Aim or Brawl). Your character must
be within range of the target, or in the same Area for Dueling and Brawl
attacks, although you could use a combined Move action to get closer to
the target.

Your character's target then gets to choose a specific Defense skill to
use to react to the attack, and an opposed roll is made. The winner of
the opposed roll gets to spend her Success Points as appropriate for the
skill she used.

###### Assist

You can assist another character by taking an Assist action. This grants
the other character bonus dice on their next roll equal to one of the
following:

- Your character's Specialty dice, if she has ranks in the Specialty she is going to use.
- Your character's Competency Die if she doesn't have ranks in the Specialty but is competent in that skill
- 1D6

A character can only receive the benefit from an Assist from two other
characters. If the benefit is not used by the end of the current round,
the benefit is lost.

**As a Combined Action:** You can't combine an Assist with other actions
that require a dice roll, but you can use it with combined actions.
Assist counts as a Drop 2 penalty when comparing against the maximum
amount of Drop from combined actions (Drop 4).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You want to assist another player in attacking an opponent with
Feint. Your character has 2 ranks in Feint, D8 for Guile, and a D8
Competency Die. You can give one of the following bonuses by assisting
her:

- 2D8 for the Feint specialty dice
- 1D8 for the Competency Die
- 1D6 as a default

Obviously in this case, you would choose the 2D8.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

###### Flourish

A Flourish is an attempt to show off your character's talents in a way
that is impressive – and which nets you Style Points.

To execute a Flourish, choose one specialty and describe how your
character is using it stylishly, as with gaining a Skill Point. Then
make a skill roll against Easy (3D6) opposition. If you are successful,
you can only spend your Success Points on gaining Style Points, up to a
maximum (as always) of three.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You have no Style Points and make a Flourish based on your
character's Dodge specialty. You roll a 14 with seven Success Points
against an opposition roll of 9, succeeding in the roll. You can only
spend your Success Points on gaining Style Points (at a cost of three
Success Points each Style Point) and describe your character leaping
onto a chair, a table, and then a barrel, looking quite dashing as she
does. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

###### Focus

A Focus is a re-centering of your character's attention, and allows you
to reroll an Initiative roll with no opposition roll. You gain the
following benefits from using Focus:

- You can change your character's position in the Initiative order to
the new value you've rolled, or stay at your original position,
whichever is better for you.

- You can increase your current number of Initiative Points by the
number that you rolled.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* At the start of the combat, you rolled a total of 5 with one
Success Point on your Initiative roll. On the first turn, you decide to
Focus and you get a better roll – a total of 11 with four Success Points
(Initiative Points); you change your position in the Initiative order to
11, and add your one Initiative Point to the four you've just rolled,
for a total five.

You later spend all five of those Initiative Points and in a subsequent
turn, Focus again, getting a total of 9 with three Success Points; your
position in the Initiative order doesn't change, but you do gain three
more Initiative Points to spend. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

###### Move or Run

Movement allows you to change your position from one Area to another
Area. A normal Move action takes you to an adjacent Area, while a Run
action lets you move through to an Area two away from your starting
position.

**As a Combined Action:** A Move is a Drop 1 penalty, and a Run is a Drop 2
penalty. The most that you can Move in one turn is two Areas, so you
can't do both a Run and a Move at the same time.

###### Prepare

You can use a Prepare action to set up an action to occur after a
specific event happens later in the round. You declare what action your
character will take and what will trigger that action. (You can choose
not to act when the trigger comes up, if circumstances have changed.)

If the end of the round comes and you have not taken the action because
the trigger event hasn't happened, then you can either choose to take
the action at the end of the turn, or forfeit your character's action
for that turn.

If you take any combined actions at the same time as your Prepare
action, you apply the Drop Penalty when you take the prepared action.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character gets ready to rush into a room after a friend
opens it, drawing her weapon (Drop 1) in the same turn that you declare
your Prepare action. Your trigger is “when the door opens” and your
character's action will be to move into the room (Drop 1) and attack
someone there. This will have a total Drop 2 penalty due to the combined
actions.

Later you prepare an attack with your sword to trigger “after my friend
disarms our opponent.” This has no extra Drop penalty, since you aren't
moving and your sword is already out. If your opponent doesn't become
disarmed by the end of the round, you can either go ahead and make your
attack, or wait until next round.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


###### Reload

The Reload action lets your character reload one of her firearms. (You
don't have to reload a bow, but you do have to reload a crossbow.) Most
weapons can be reloaded in one round, but it takes a total of 5 uses of
Reload to reload a cannon.

**As a Combined Action:** Reloading a pistol or a crossbow is a Drop 2
penalty. Reloading a musket is a Drop 3 penalty. You can reload two
pistols in one round, since that would be a Drop 4 penalty total, and
Drop 4 is the limit of combined actions you can take in one round.

###### Use a Skill

This is a catch-all category for using a Specialty or Skill in a way
which isn't an attack, either using the Specialty's own Success Tables
or the generic table for Non-Combat Actions in Combat. (See the start of
the Skills document in the playtest packet.)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You decide to use the Deceive specialty to distract your
character's opponent in a fight: “Hey, look, the Guardian's cavaliers
are behind you\!” Normally, Deceive takes one minute to use and doesn't
have a direct combat application, so instead you use the Success Table
for Non-Combat Actions. With your Success Points, you buy increases in
Advantage to represent your successful bluff.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Advantage

Advantage is an abstraction of how well your character is doing in a
fight, expressed as a die value from D6 to D12. Advantage represents a
wide variety of in-fiction states, including your character's relative
positioning in an Area, her general sense of how the fight is going, her
superior stance to her opponent, and even whether or not she is feeling
the rhythm of the fight.

##### Increasing Advantage

You begin every combat with no Advantage Die and can increase your
Advantage by spending Success Points, depending upon the Success Table
for an action you've completed. The first time you buy an increase in
Advantage, your Advantage Die goes up to D6; then D8, D10, and D12 with
subsequent (or simultaneous) expenditures of Success Points on
increasing Advantage.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You decide you want your character to make a Feint attack
against her opponent, and you succeed with three Success Points. It's
the start of the fight, so you have no Advantage to begin with, but the
Increase Advantage option on the Feint success table lets you spend one
Success Point for each increase of Advantage. The first point gives you
a D6 Advantage Die, then the following two increase that die size to
D10, spending all three of your Success Points.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Using Advantage

You can include your Advantage die on any attack or defense roll that
you make during combat. Each time you use your Advantage Die, it steps
down one size – from D10 to D8, for example, or from D6 to no Advantage
Die.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You make a Lunge attack and elect to include your Advantage
Die, which currently stands at a D10. You add a D10 to your dice pool
for the attack, and after resolving the Lunge roll, your Advantage Die
drops to a D8.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Other Combat Modifiers

Drop penalties can be applied during a fight based on the fictional
circumstances – for example, if you are on the pitching and rolling deck
of a ship, the MJ can impose a Drop 1 penalty on physical skill checks.

If an area provides cover from attacks, that imposes a Drop 1 or Drop 2
penalty on attacks that fire into that area.

#### Damage

There are two types of damage in *The Queen's Cavaliers*: 
**Yield**, which is non-lethal, and
**Wounds**, which bring a character closer to death while imposing penalties
on combat-related actions.

##### Yield

Yield is an abstraction representing a character's energy, enthusiasm
for battle, fatigue level, and will to fight.

Each character has a Yield Limit that represents how many points of
Yield she can take until being out of a combat. An NPC who reaches her
Yield Limit will either surrender or be knocked unconscious, at the
option of the MJ. A PC who reaches her Yield Limit can stay in the
fight, but if she does, every attack against her gains the following
addition to its Success Table:

:::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::
|          | (Yielded Out)          |
| :------- | :--------------------- |
| +:       | Inflict 1 Wound        |
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds
than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and from one
to five for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and is dying.

This even applies to attacks such as Feint or Brawl which can not
normally inflict Wounds. (See the next section for information on
Wounds.)

At the end of a combat, after the combatants have a chance to catch
their breath, all Yield taken is reset to zero – although the effects of
reaching a Yield Limit such as surrender or unconsciousness will
continue (although not the Success Table addition for continuing to
fight past your Yield Limit). Unconscious characters will remain
unconscious for one or more scenes at the MJ's discretion, unless awoken
by others during or after the combat.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* You hit with a Lunge attack, with five Success Points. You
decide to spend all five points on Yield, inflicting five Yield on your
opponent. Your opponent has a Yield Limit of four, which means that the
MJ decides you knock her back against a wall and she hits her head,
going unconscious and is out of the fight.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Wounds

A Wound represents a more serious injury than gaining Yield: Wounds
don't heal at the end of the combat, and they inflict Drop Penalties on
characters suffering from them.

Each player character can take four Wounds until being forced out of the
combat, dying. NPCs can take anywhere from one wound (for Rabble) to
five wounds (for Major Characters) – see the Opponents document in the
playtest packet for more information.

In addition, whenever a character takes a Wound, her Yield Limit decreases by one.

The Drop Penalties and Yield Limit changes for each Wound level are shown on the following table:

Table: Drop Penalty from Wounds

| Wounds | Drop Penalty              | Yield Limit |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| None   | Drop 0                    | –           | 
| 1      | Drop 1                    | \-1         |
| 2      | Drop 2                    | \-2         |
| 3      | Drop 4                    | \-3         |
| 4      | Dying (for Wound Limit 4) | \-4         |
| 5      | Dying (for Wound Limit 5) | \-5         |
| 6      | Dying (for Wound Limit 6) | \-6         |

Drop Penalties from Wounds are cumulative with Drop Penalties for combined actions, and apply to the following skills and specialties:

- Defense (all Specialties)
- Dueling (all Specialties)
- Military (Brawl, Aim)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character is stabbed by an opponent's Lunge attack and
receives one Wound. You now get a Drop 1 penalty on all applicable
actions, such as attacking or defending. Later in the fight, you are
shot for two more Wounds, which increases your penalty to Drop 4 – one
more Wound and you'll be Dying.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Dying and Death

A Dying character is unconscious for the rest of the combat and cannot take actions.

At the end of the combat, any Dying non-player character dies unless the
player characters make a successful attempt (using the Medicine skill)
to save that NPC – although the MJ can rule that certain NPCs are beyond
saving due to the extent of their injuries.

If a player character is Dying at combat's end, that character's player
can decide to have the character expire – possibly after awakening long
enough to speak some last words to a companion – or receive treatment
through the Medicine skill to keep that character alive.

If the Medicine skill is unsuccessful or the wounds are untreated, the
player can make a Survival Roll using her character's Verve plus her
Competency Die against Moderate Opposition (3D8).


::::::::::::::::: success ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
| Survival Roll |                                      | 
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| Pool:         | Verve + Competency Die               | 
| Opposition:   | Standard Opposition – Moderate (3D8) |
| +:            | Survive for 8 Hours                  |
| ++:           | Regain Consciousness                 |
| ++++:         | Heal 1 Wound                         |
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Survive for 8 Hours:** The dying character doesn't die of her wounds for
another eight hours per Success Point spent. Make another Survival Roll
at the end of that time period.

**Regain Consciousness:** The dying character is awake and can speak and
react to the world around her, but can't take any actions.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The dying character heals one wound and is no longer
dying.

On a failed Survival Roll, the character dies.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Your character receives a fourth Wound, taking her out of the
fight. At the end of the fight, you can decide if she dies of her
injuries, or fights to survive. If you choose the latter, and there's no
medical aid nearby, you'll need to make a Survival Roll.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Healing Wounds

Unlike Yield, Wounds don't simply go away at the end of a combat. There are two ways to heal Wounds: the Medicine skill, and bed rest.

Resting for two days will heal one Wound. Six days' bed rest is enough to fully heal all Wounds.

Located in the middle of western Elara, Gallinea considers itself the heart of the world. 
With fertile farmlands throughout the Gallinean valley and abundant natural resources, 
the queendom of Gallinea has become a major power in recent centuries. Gallinea, 
like most of the continent of Elara, was once part of the ancient Qartan Empire.


### Atlas of Gallinea

Located in the middle of western Elara, Gallinea considers itself the
heart of the world. With fertile farmlands throughout the Gallinean
valley and abundant natural resources, the queendom of Gallinea has
become a major power in recent centuries. Gallinea, like most of the
continent of Elara, was once part of the ancient Qartan Empire.

All told, there are 46 different provinces in Gallinea, including
Lutetia, Valerienne, Berylle, Rhodope, and Scanbria. Each is controlled
by a countess, baroness, or duchess (or, rarely, a count, baron, or
duke) and all pledge loyalty to the Queen.

Apart from the major cities, the rest of the provinces are rural farming
fiefdoms, and many from Lutetia tend to look down upon their less
sophisticated, less cosmopolitan countrymen.

#### Lutetia

The capital of Gallinea, Lutetia is built upon a lake island and
surrounded by 16 huge bridges that reach out to the farmlands and
estates that circle the city.

Lutetia is known for its majestic architecture as well as its green
parks. Landmarks include the Royal Palace, the Universities of Lutetia,
the Grand Cathedral, and the Gallinean Library.

Members of the Lutetian court include:

Queen Mariana: A mere 23 years old, Mariana was never intended to be
Queen; that was meant for her older sister, Crown Princess Jehanne. The
tragic assassination of her mother, Queen Elisse, and Princess Jehanne
catapulted her to the throne unexpectedly. The Queen's champions are
traditionally known as the Queen's Cavaliers.

Prince-Consort Carolus: A princeling from Albia, Carolus was wed to
Princess Mariana at a young age to cement the Treaty of Scanbreille. Now
the consort to the Queen of Gallinea, he often finds himself at odds
with the matriarchal, progressive views of his bride. By tradition, the
Prince-Consort is the honorary head of the Cavaliers.

Guardian Farrazin: The head Chaplain of Lutetia, Guardian of the Faith
Farrazin is an ambitious and cunning man. The Corderan-educated cleric
seeks to expand the power of Gallinea throughout the world, and increase
his own personal authority as well. His own Holy Guardsmen are in an
ongoing rivalry with the Queen's Cavaliers.

Prince-Father Michel Aubene: Younger brother of the Duchess of
Valerienne, Michel was the husband and consort of Queen until her
untimely death. He served for a year as prince-regent before Queen
Mariana ascended the throne on her 18th birthday, and he often finds
himself disagreeing with Prince-Consort Carolus, his Albian son-in-law.

Lord-Ambassador Bedyngford: The Duke of Bedyngford is the current
ambassador to Gallinea from Albia. He delights in the fashions and
pageantry of the Lutetian court, and is a frequent drinking partner of
his younger countryman, Prince Carolus.

Lady-Mayor Lusienne Castenia: The countess of Castenia is the current
lady-mayor of Lutetia, and is renowned as much for her lavish formal
parties as her political scheming. 


#### Cities

Gallinea has a total population of 26.5 million. 
About 10% of Gallinea's population lives in a city; the 
rest of the population is rural.

The largest cities in Gallinea are listed in the following table.

#### Bodies of Water

##### The Great Sea

The largest body of water near Gallinea is the Great Sea, often known by its Ekalian name of Oceanus.
Located to the west of Elara, Oceanus is known to be rough and dangerous, with huge waves and strong
winds dissuading any sailors who dare venture further than the Storm Islands which act as a form of
breakwater for the mainland.

The Bay of Gallinea -- also called the Bay of Albia -- is located between those two neighboring
countries. During the Twenty Years' War, this bay was the site of many naval battles between
Albia and Gallinea, and the sea floor is said to be littered with shipwrecks and the skeletons of
the dead.

##### The Middle Sea

A far safer ocean than Oceanus is the Middle Sea, which connects Gallinea with Ondala, Dragosa, Pitdah,
Ubar, and even the ruins of Qarta for those who would dare venture there. Relatively placid and safe, 
the Middle Sea is used extensively for commerce.

The far west part of the Middle Sea, just before it joins the Great Sea, is known as the Ondalan 
Channel. At the closest point, only about 15 leagues separates Gallinea from Ondala, making this a
highly strategic passage to control. Most of Gallinea's wars with Ondala have been fought over the
Ondalan Channel.

The Sea of Ekalia is located between Gallinea and Dragosa, and in fact contains all the islands of Ekalia.
There are large fishing fleets working the sound, many of which tether together against huge barges to
form ad hoc "cities" on artificial "islands."

##### Rivers

The largest river in Gallinea is the Luisante, which flows from headwaters in the north through Lutetia
and finally empties in the Middle Sea in Valerienne, a journey of over 400 leagues. The river is slow
and wide, making travel between the Jeweled Coast and Coeur de Gallinea easy and efficient. Only
above Lutetia does the Luisante take on the sparkling clarity for which it's named, with the rest of
its length being a muddy brown. 

Luisante is so significant to Gallinea culture that if one says simply
"The River," it's understood to be a reference to the Luisante.

The Lente is a major tributory of the Luisante, originating in the Lendine mountains from which it
takes its name. A fast-moving river, the Lente is only useful for travel downstream to Gueve, just before
it merges with the Luisante.

The Boueuse also feeds into the Luisante, meandering through the farms and villages of the Lowlands.
The sluggish pace of the river is often compared to the slower, less complicated country life of the
agricultural provinces through which it flows.

The largest eastern river is the Verte, which flows into the Great Sea at Verterre. It has two major branches,
both of which are known as the Verte. The North Verte river is primarily used for logging in the
forests of the northern Lowlands, and the South Verde for transporting food from the farms of the
middle Lowlands.

Gallinea has a number of smaller lakes but no truly large ones, although some of the Scanbrian lakes
in the north are of decent size. The most well-known lake is Lac Luisante, upon which the city of 
Lutetia was built.

#### The Jeweled Coast

The seaports along the southern and eastern coast of Gallinea are known as the Jeweled Cities. 
The largest of these is Valerienne; others include Berylle and Rhodope. Arynne Aubene, the 
Duchess of Valerienne, is the sister of Prince-Father Michel.

The cities of the Jeweled Coast are known for their talents with clockworks and other forms of 
technology and scientific artifice.




##### Locations
The major cities on the Jeweled Coast include Berylle, Canard-Noir, Montambre, Persolei, Rhodope, and Valerienne

The Rue de la Mar connects all of the Jeweled Cities together, although there is also frequent traffic by sea between the cities as well.

###### Berylle

The closest of the Jeweled Cities to Lutetia, Berylle is located in the middle of the Jeweled Coast near the site of an old
Qartan mining town and natural spring. Rue de Berylle connects the seaport of 100,000 with the capital, and is the only major roadway
in Gallinea built after the fall of the Qartan Empire.

###### Canard-Noir

The unfortunately named Canard-Noir is the smallest of the large cities on the Jeweled Coast, with a permanent population of
only 50,000. Located on the banks of the Canard river, Canard-Noir is known for its blacksmithing and metalworking.
The young comtesse Josette de Canard-Noir makes no secret of her desire to expand her city's influence, nor her
disdain for the rest of the Jeweled Cities.

###### Montambre


Montambre is the northernmost of the Jeweled Cities, and accordingly trades extensively with Varendia as well as Ekalia to the
east. Most of the population of 90,000 work in the mines and smelteries of Montambre, creating weapons that are of high quality
and even higher demand.


###### Persolei

It's said that Persolei is the farthest you can go in Gallinea and still be in Gallinea. While that's technically accurate in only about
half the provinces of Gallinea, it's true that Persolei is located far to the southwest of the country. The people of Persolei are
almost as much Ondalan as they are Gallinean; on a clear day, they can see across the channel to Puerto Salida. With architecture heavily
influenced by Diegan styles and a populace of 85,000, most of whom are bilingual, Marquis Gaspar de Persolei hopes to keep Lutetia on
good terms with Queen Ximena to the south, as Persolei was repeatedly razed during the last war with Ondala. And the war before that. And
the war before *that* ...

###### Rhodope

Rhodope is a seaport of 125,000 people located on the easternmost coast of Gallinea. Their
major export is clockwork machinery, and they trade extensively with their Ekalian neighbors.
Along with Persolei, Rhodope is notable for having a male duchess, known as a "duke," a man
named Baudouin de Longpre. It's said that Baudoin would love to step down in favor of his
daughter, Genevieve, but the younger de Longpre impulsively spends her time fooling around
with the Queen's Cavaliers ... and fooling around with any pretty face that catches her eye.

###### Valerienne

Valerienne is the second-largest city in Gallinea and called the "Jewel of Gallinea" -- 
primarily by its residents and never by the people of Lutetia.  The current Duchess is 
Arynne Aubene, older sister of Prince-Father Michel.

As Lutetia is known for its bridges, so is Valerienne known for its canals. 
Fully 75% of the city is located on islands in the delta region of the Luisante River, 
and small canal boats are used to navigate through Valerienne in lieu of paved roads. 
Walkways line the canals as well, although those are usually only wide enough to accommodate hand carts.

Due to its location on the Jeweled Coast and the Luisante, Valerienne is a center of trade 
going in and out of Gallinea to the Middle Sea, to Ondala, and to the colony of Elissia. 
As a result, Valerienne is a wealthy and cosmopolitan town of 200,000 people where multiple 
languages can be heard among the piers and quays of the expansive district known as the Docks.

Valerienne is home to the largest number of Talanian refugees outside of Dragosa. 
These expatriates have settled in a district bordering the Docks which has been named New Zamorov, 
similar to other ethnic enclaves of the same name found in other major cities. Tensions have 
been rising lately between the Talanian immigrants and the older residents of Valerienne, due to a
perception of increased crime.




##### Style Maneuvers

The following style maneuvers can be taken by any character from the Jeweled Coast,
or by any character who has spent an extensive amount of
time in a Jewel City studying the people and the culture.

  - **Buccaneeer Style:** Add Feint to Aim: When fighting with a smallsword, cutlass, or rapier in one hand and a pistol in the other hand, spend 1 Style Point to add Feint dice to an Aim roll.
  - **Practiced Crafting:** Spend 2 Style Points to set the value of one Clockworks die to its maximum value before rolling
  - **Watchful Reliability:** Spend 1 Style Point to reroll an Observation roll

#### Scanbria

Many Scanbrians are of Varendish ancestry, and the lands of Scanbria were 
once a separate nation. After several wars with both Varendia and Albia, 
Scanbria was incorporated into Gallinea and has been loyal to the throne 
for several centuries.

The main city in Scanbria is Scanbreille, ruled by Jennevive d'Angelet, 
the Duchess of Scanbria, and her husband Lord Gerhardt from Varendia. 
The peace of the last few years has led to an increase in wealth for the
canbrians, situated along trade routes between Gallinea, Albia, and Varendia. 
Scanbria is also known for its textile industries.

Other cities in Scanbria include:

- Affûtaine

#### The Lowlands

The Lowlands of Gallinea refers to a large region that includes much of central and western Gallinea.
In addition, anything west of the Luisante River or along its banks, south of Guéve, is considered part of the Lowlands.
The Lowlands are agricultural provinces that farm food for the rest of Gallinea.




##### Locations

Cities in the Lowlands include Boussole, Sudelune, and Verterre.

###### Boussol

Boussole is a small city on Rue de la Mar of 55,000 and is the capital of the County of Boussole. 
It is located on the west coast of Gallinea, adjacent to the Great Sea. Rue des Bois connects Boussole with Lutetia and other point inland.

###### Sudelune

Sudelune is the capital of the county of the same name, and has a population of about 50,000. 
Situated to the far southwest of Gallinea and nestled against the Southern Mountains, 
Sudelune is perhaps best known for being the home of Clarisse Sudelune, a military hero of the 12th century
who later married the Queen.

###### Verterre

Verterre is the largest city in the Lowlands, with a population exceeding 75,000. Situated 
on the banks of the Verte river where it meets the Great Sea, Verterre is a farming and fishing
community. The Rue de Coeur makes it easy for the Marquise of Verterre to get her marquessate's
products to market in Lutetia and beyond.




##### Style Maneuvers

The following style maneuvers can be taken by any character from the Lowlands
or by any character who has spent an extensive amount of
time in the rural provinces studying the people and the culture.

  - **Practiced Cultivation:** Spend 2 Style Points to set the value of one Husbandry die to its maximum value before rolling
  - **Ritual Reliability:** Spend 1 Style Point to reroll a Magicks roll

### Gallinean Culture #

Gallinea has a long history as a matriarchy, and in recent centuries has become 
known for its very egalitarian and inclusive views – a philosophy which has been 
tested since the former monarch, Queen Elisse, was assassinated. Her youngest 
daughter, now Queen Mariana, has tried to maintain her mother's policy of 
tolerance in the face of increasing clamor for a less open society.

Gender equality is usually a given in Gallinea, and freedom of religion is enforced 
by law – although only Asrianism is broadly accepted. Heterosexuality is the norm, 
but pansexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality are all embraced and supported by 
society. Gallinean inheritance passes along a matrilineal path, so most heads of 
noble families are female. The symbol of Gallinea is the pegasus.

#### Languages in Gallinea

The primary language of Gallinea is, of course, modern Gallinean. The language is
structurally descended from Old Qartan, but with many native words and names also
based in the indigenous Brigue that predates the Qartan Empire's conquest of the land.

While some Gallineans hold to the arrogance that their tongue is the height of civilization
and thus the only language one need to know, Gallinea's constant interactions with its
neighboring countries means the most practical Gallineans will speak and read at least
one additional languages.

:::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Old Gallinean is French?

While *The Queen's Cavaliers* is written in English, many of the older names for
locations, families, and specific traditions are French. We use French to indicate
an older version of Gallinean than is spoken by modern inhabitants of the queendom.
Contemporary Gallineans can certainly understand the language of several centuries
back, but it sounds old-fashioned and archaic, much as Shakespeare sounds to modern
speakers of English.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The languages commonly known in Gallinea are listed on the following table. Those considered
"dead languages" are shown in italics.

Table: Languages

| Language          | Linguistic Roots                       | Alphabet  |

| Albian            | Ancient Varendish, Old Qartan, Mathain | Qartan    |

| *Old Qartan*      | Khefikkan, Karangan, Ancient Ekalian   | Qartan    |
| Ondalese          | Old Qartan                             | Qartan    |
| Serican           |                                        | Serican   |
| Talanian          | Ancient Varendish                      | Varendish |
| Varendish         | Ancient Varendish                      | Varendish |

**Albian** is primarily spoken in Albia and its colony, New Dunon, as well as the Storm
Islands and the region of Varendia known as Albingia. Many Gallineans learned Albian
during the Twenty Years' War for strategic reasons, and just as many refused to speak
a word of it for patriotic reasons.

**Brigue** is the language of the original inhabitants of Gallinea more than two millennia
back. Despite lending its words to many Gallinean place names, there are no known native 
speakers of Brigue alive today. The language does continue to be used by witches and others
who follow the Old Faith; however, most view phrases in Brigue to be merely "magick
words" with no meaning outside of rituals and superstition.

**Ekalian** is spoken in Gallinea's close neighbor to the east. The ubiquity of Ekalian
sailors in every port has made it the de facto language of sea commerce, and this is
evidenced by the number of Jeweled Coast natives who speak it fluently. Ekalian is also
one of the three languages spoken in Dragosa.

**Gallinean** is also spoken in Elissia, Gallinea's West Ifran colony. Each region of Gallinea 
has its own dialect, and those with an ear for accents and vocabulary can narrow down a Gallinean's
home province quite easily. Scanbrian Gallinean mixes in rough-sounding Varendish language,
while Jeweled-Coast Gallinean has an Ekalian lilt. Lutetians speak Gallinean at a fast
rate, while Lowlanders favor a slow drawl.

**Ifrani** is spoken in the cities of Pitdah and Ubar, as well as throughout the Ifrani
Desert. Although it's not a requirement of the faith, most Devran *Songs of the Desert Mother*
collections are written in the cursive, flowing Aad script. In Gallinea, Ifrani is spoken
primarily within Devran communities.

**Karangan** is the language of The Furthest South, more properly known as Mwene Karanga. 
Few Gallineans even know the name "Mwene Karanga," let alone speak even a word of the language.
Karangan is a rich, complex tongue suitable not only for sociopolitical exchanges but
also highly technical discussions. For the latter reason, a handful of mechanicians are
trying to learn the language.

**Khefikkan** originates in Kheffika, more commonly known in Gallinea as the Coffee Coast.
Khefikkan predates the Qartan Empire and in fact was a precursor to both Old Qartana and the
aboriginal Brigue of Gallinea. Today it's primarily spoken by those who trade extensively with
the lands to the east of Elara.

**Mathain** is the language of the original inhabitants of Bear Island, now part of Albia.
Most Mathain survives in the form of ancient carvings in the Mathac script, a series of slashes
and cuts in stone ruins.

**Old Qartan** was spoken throughout the Qartan Empire and has had the biggest linguistic
impact on Elara and northern Ifran. While few people speak Old Qartan today, it's used ceremonially
in the Asrian religion and *The Books of the Sun* are written in Old Qartan. Thus, every
Asrian Chaplain, and many other lay scholars, can read and write Old Qartan effortlessly.

**Ondalese** is the most direct descendant of Old Qartan; in fact, some speakers of 
Ondalese even refer to it as Modern Qartan. This is a bit misguided, however, as much of
the vocabulary and even sentence structure has changed drastically over the last 1400 years.
Most speakers of Ondalese can't understand Old Qartan at all.

**Serican** is the language of the lands beyond even the Coffee Coast, in the sprawling 
confederation of nation-states known as Serica and Shan. In truth, there are more than a 
dozen other languages spoken in Serica, but speakers from the Sekai region have engaged in
the most trade with Elara, so when a Gallinean thinks of "Serican", she's actually thinking of
Sekai. Serican is an ideographic language whose written form proves difficult for most
Gallineans to master reading or writing.

**Talanian** was formerly spoken primarily in Talania, but with the Shattering Frost and 
resulting Talanian diaspora, the tongue has spread throughout Elara. Talanian is also one
of the three primary languages of Dragosa. In Gallinea, Talanian is most often used in
Valerienne, where many refugees from Talania have settled.

**Varendish** is one of the few unifying factors of the patchwork states known as Varendia.
The common language serves to keep them culturally united even as it also limits their
cultural and technological evolation. The runic script of Varendish is ill-suited for
many modern concepts, so even in Varendia, most scientific and theological writings are
in Gallinean or Albian.


#### Gender, Sexuality, and Race # {.breakbefore}

In general, Gallinea is a diverse nation, full of people of all genders,
sexualities, and races. While that mostly holds true upon closer
examination, the Land of the Ascendant Pegasus does still retain some
inequalities based on old traditions and biases.

##### Gender

Gallinean custom has long held the primacy of women within society --
after all, the traditionalists argue, it is women who maintain the
stability of culture. The identity of one's other parent may be in
doubt, but there's never a question about who gave birth to a child.
Thus, inheritance passes along matrilineal lines and thus concentrating
wealth and societal power among women.

This rule still holds true for most nobles -- and continues to be an
expectation of the Royalty -- but has lost popularity among those in the
lower social classes. 

###### The Delphian Reforms

Queen Delphine, great-grandmother of current queen Mariana, decreed in
1172 PQ that inheritance within Gallinea would pass to the oldest child
regardless of gender -- and as much as this pleased the commoners, it
enraged the nobility to the same extent. Two years later, in 1174 PQ,
she rescinded that decree and replaced it with a rule that each family
could designate either the oldest daughter or oldest son as inheritor.
Most nobles stuck to the old ways, however, and named daughters as
heirs.

Delphine's granddaughter, Queen Elisse III, expanded the decree in 1240
to allow any child to be named as an heir, regardless of birth order or
gender, as part of her Elissian Reforms. After Elisse's assassination,
her husband (as prince-regent) and her daughter Queen Mariana maintained
the Reforms enacted by Elisse before her death, but haven't yet enacted
the further reforms desired by the late queen.

Besides inheritance, other forms of gender discrimination have likewise
been banned since Delphine's reign, but most positions of authority and
responsibility within Gallinean higher society are still held by women.

###### Gender and the Church

Traditional Asrian theology holds that the First Prohibition, "Let no
man be superior to a woman," defines a role for a woman as the head of a
family, head of a country, and head of a business, but modern
interpretations over the last millennium have taken this to be a call
for gender-neutrality and lack of gender-based oppression.

The Asrian Church has thus become a bastion of gender equality, although
with persistent trappings of matriarchy -- Eserre is viewed as a sun
goddess as opposed to a gender-neutral deity, for example. The Church is
headed by the Bride of the Sun and her Handmaidens, which are ceremonial
positions that are treated as female for liturgical purposes, regardless
of the gender of the occupant of the office. 

Within Gallinean politics, the Church takes a middle line between the
beliefs of the Monarchy and the nobility, not quite willing to fully
endorse the Elissian Reforms but nonetheless prompting for greater
equality of gender within Asrian culture.

###### Gender Diversity 

With the increased acceptance of gender equality has also come greater
acceptance of those who don't fall into a binary gender assigned to them
at birth. Gender roles have become understood as a question of
self-identification, including people who exist outside of a strict
binary as well as those who are comfortable within it.

Female and male identities are considered legitimate regardless of birth
assignment. Legal recognition of gender is not required for all but
those in the higher tiers of society, and the procedure itself is a
relatively simple procedure before a or a royal bailiff or a provincial
prévôt. Petitioners receive a decree in the name of the queen or the
nobility of the province, recognizing their gender for all purposes.

The Elissian Decrees went further than that, and legally recognized all
variations of gender identity -- from those without gender at all to
those who combine either binary gender in ways unique to that
individual. This codified a long-standing practice among the lower and
middle classes of affirming the genders of everyone, not just those
within a strict binary.

###### Gender in the Gallinean Language

The Gallinean language is a relatively genderless tongue that does not
require that a grammatical gender be assigned to every noun, verb, or
pronoun. However, as with most Qartan-descended languages, many
traditional names for occupations, noble titles, place of origin, and so
on, are expressed in female terminology. Older Gallineans consider these
terms to be gender-neutral by default, but younger speakers of the
language are moving toward more inclusive speech.

"She" is the default pronoun for a person of unspecified gender within
classical Gallinean, but there has been some progress made toward using
"they" as gender-neutral as well. "Iel/iem/ier/iels/ielself", a set of
non-binary pronouns used in some classical writings, has made a recent
resurgence and is used within the texts of the Elissian Reforms.

While physiological alterations are never required of those asserting
their gender within Gallinean society -- for legal or for social
purposes -- many such individuals desire changes to their bodies to
better match their self-image. Long-known alchemical formulations can
provide the equivalent of hormone replacement to those who wish it, and
a number of medical procedures exist that can provide further changes to
bring one's body into conformance with their stated gender.

Gender Terminology

- **Clarissic:** An adjective describing someone whose gender is not that
assigned at birth. A reference to Clarisse Sudelune, a former soldier,
Maréchale Général de Gallinea, princess-consort, and princess-regent in
the 12th century PQ.
- **Female:** An adjective describing someone who is a woman.
- **Male:** An adjective describing someone who is a man.
- **Man:** Someone who is male.
- **Maverique (adj):** An adjective describing someone who has a gender which is not male, female, or a combination of those.
- **Maverique (n):** Someone whose gender is *maverique (adj)*.
- **Neutrois:** An adjective describing someone who does not have a gender.
- **Person:** Someone who is of any gender.
- **Perybrean:** An adjective describing someone whose gender is a combination
  of male and female, with that combination either being fixed or fluid
  over time. Named after the Ekalian twin deities Peryon and Sybrea who
  are to be reflections of each other or possibly the same god.
- **Woman:** Someone who is female.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Sexuality

The concept of "homosexuality" and "heterosexuality" as distinct sexual
orientations is unknown within Gallinean society. Society, overall, is
bisexual and one's preference for specific genders is considered a
personal matter. No one cares whether this is an inborn preference or a
matter of choice; you love who you love, and that's what matters. 

The second Profession of Asrianism states that love is a gift from
Eserre herself, and the Books of the Sun encourage all to love as freely
as you wish, love as deeply as you wish, and love whomever you wish.
Eserre herself is depicted as married to a woman, the first Bride of the
Sun, and thus all subsequent leaders of the Asrian church have been
considered liturgically female.

###### Marriage in Gallinea

Marriage or partnership within Gallinean culture can be between a woman
and a man, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, and recently, between
any one person and another regardless of gender or lack thereof.
Monogamy is expected among Asrian Gallineans, although monoamory is a
matter left up to the people in the relationship. Thus, you can only be
married to one person, but it a mutual decision between the two of you
whether it is an open relationship or a closed one.

The term "marriage" is reserved for those couples united in a religious
ceremony; otherwise it is called a "partnership". Terms such as "wife",
"husband", "spouse", or "partner", are not restricted to one type of
union; as with many other decisions this is made by each couple as they
choose. Gallineans consider all terms to refer to the same concept,
although classical Gallinean traditionally calls male spouses "husbands"
and female spouses "wives."

In recent years, greater acceptance has been made of those who are not
sexually attracted at all. Previously, asexual people were thought of as
being eccentric, of being damaged in some way, or as just not having
found the right person yet. One decree in the Elissian Reforms
establishes full legal equality, including inheritance rights, to people
who are asexual.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Sexuality Terminology

- **Jathyc:** An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two men, named after the Ekalian deity Jathys, god of craftsmanship and commerce.
- **Outré:** An archaic adjective describing a man who is exclusively attracted to women, or a woman who is exclusively attracted to men.  Often considered offensive.
- **Reian (adj):** A recently-coined adjective describing someone who does not
  feel sexual attraction, or sometimes, romantic attraction. Named after
  the Ekalian deity Reios, god of politics and the underworld.
- **Reian (n)**. Someone whose sexuality is *reian (adj)*.
- **Sapphique:** An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two women, named after Safira, the first Bride of the Sun according to Asrian theology.

There are no particular terms for being a bisexual person, a lesbian, or a gay man in Gallinean. Such concepts don't exist in Elaran cultures.

##### Surnames

Surnames in Gallinean are usually one of four different types:

  - **Occupational** -- based on one's profession (or the profession of one's family)
  - **Matronymic** -- based on the name of one's mother, or another female ancestor
  - **Geographical** -- based on where one comes from
  - **Descriptive** -- evolved from a nickname, usually based on someone's appearance or an ancestor's appearance

Many geographical or occupational names begin with an article such as *de*, *du*, *des*, *de la*, *d'*, *la*, *le*, and *l'*
Such articles are sometimes dropped, and other times incorporated directly into the name (as with Deveaux).

Some foreigners use non-Gallinean locations with Gallinean articles as surnames, 
such as l'Albien (literally "the Albian") or d'Eccalea ("of Ekalia").

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
  - *Deveaux* is an occupational name; Martine Deveaux comes from a farming family that at one time was known for selling veal.
  - *Aubene* is a matronymic name; Arynne Aubene and her brother Prince-Father Michel Aubene are named for their foremother Aubigny.
  - *Castenia* is a geographical name; Lusienne Castenia's family once used the surname "de Castenia" but have since dropped the article.
  - *d'Angelet* is a descriptive name. One of Jennevive d'Angelet's ancestors was described as having the
    voice of an angel, and the name was passed on to her heirs.

Alais de Neversette

In the year 1199 PQ, a previously unknown writer named M.E. Labouret published a novel called "The Laughing Blade" that introduced a new character, Alais de Neversette.

"The Laughing Blade" took Lutetia by storm, and for the last fifty years there have been at least one book in The Various Adventures of Alais Neversette, save for the darkest year of 1244.

Alais lives in the first half of the reign of Queen Delphine -- usually said to be the 1150s to 1160s -- and is the daughter of a minor noblewoman who snuck out from her studies and saved Princess-Regent Clarisse, the young queen's stepmother, from an assassination attempt. This bravery earned her a spot in the Queen's Cavaliers, over the objections of her doting mother and father.

Alais de Neversette is known for three qualities: her reckless abandon, her sexual promiscuity, and her love for wordplay. In the earliest stories she had a pronounced sexist streak -- quite biased against males (even as she romanced them for the cause of the Queen) -- but that aspect has been played down in recent years. She is bisexual and her relationships -- be they with women, men, or others -- legendarily end in heartbreak or death by the end of each novel.

Starting with the second book in 1200 PQ, the titles all began with "Alais de Neversette and ...", and in 1203 the core line of books began being called by the collective title "The Amazing Adventures of Alais de Neversette." Several additional series have appeared, including "The Nautical Adventures of Alais de Neversette," "The Secret Adventures of Alais de Neversette," "The Erotic Adventures of Alais de Neversette," and "The Wartime Adventures of Alais de Neversette." Each series takes a different approach to the character; "Wartime" is about her fictional exploits published during the 20 Years War, for example, while "Erotic" is decidedly not for children.

Highly popular among the common people, Alais is dismissed as dreadfully overwritten prose among those who fancy themselves more educated -- although the enduring popularity of the character and her books have led a minority of scholars to take a greater interest in the books.

The exact identity of M.E. Labouret is unknown, and it's said that even her publishers don't know her true identity. The theories held by Alais scholars is that Labouret is a pen named shared by several people over the years, perhaps a family, as distinctive patterns run through certain books and not others. Most scholars agree that the writer(s) of Alais are natives of Lutetia, and probably from the educated artisan class.

The books are reviled by many of the older members of the Queen's Cavaliers as they present a wholly unrealistic and slightly ridiculous view of life in the Queen's service, but in recent years, many of the new recruits are people who have grown up reading about Alais. Despite the greyswords' opinions, the "Adventures" may be one of the greatest recruiting tools for the Cavaliers and a source of at least some of the public goodwill toward the Queen's Cavaliers.

Several of Alais de Neversette's fictional adventures have been adapted for the stage. Most of these have been performed only in the smaller or common theatres of Gallinea, but a few have had higher profile performances -- although none in front of a royal audience.

"The Laughing Blade" is the story most often adapted for these plays, often titled as "Alais de Neversette and the Laughing Blade." A musical version of "The Nautical Adventures of Alais de Neversette: Alais de Neversette and the Hidden Reef" is one of the largest crowd-pleasers, and has given young Lutetians the idea that all pirates are singing pirates.

#### The Gallinean Calendar

Years in Elara are measured from the abandonment of Qarta (Post Qarta), which dates to 1 PQ. Dates before 1 PQ are dated backwards with Before Qarta (BQ). A year without PQ/BQ notation is presumed to be PQ.

##### Months ##

Months are named for the common weather in Lutetia during each month.

Table: Months of the Year

| Number | Month Name  | Birthstone | Season |
| :----: | :---------- | :--------- | :----- |
| 1      | Pluviôse    | Garnet     | Winter |
| 2      | Ventôse     | Amethyst            |
| 3      | Germinal    | Bloodstone | Spring |
| 4      | Floréal     | Sapphire   |        |
| 5      | Prairial    | Agate      |        |
| 6      | Messidor    | Emerald    | Summer |
| 7      | Fervidor    | Onyx       |        |
| 8      | Fructidor   | Carnelian  |        |
| 9      | Vendémiaire | Peridot    | Autumn |
| 10     | Brumaire    | Beryl      |        |
| 11     | Frimaire    | Topaz      |        |
| 12     | Nivôse      | Ruby       | Winter |

The neighboring countries have their own days for the months in their own languages. For example, in Albian, the months are Rainous, Windous, Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal, Reapidor, Heatidor, Fruitidor, Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious, and Snowous.

Each month has 30 days. Each year has 360 days.

##### Days of the Week

There are six days of the week in the Gallinean calendar. There are 5 weeks in every month.

Table: Days of the Week

| Number | Day Name   |
| :----: | :--------- |
| 1      | Moon Day   |
| 2      | Second Day |
| 3      | Third Day  |
| 4      | Fourth Day |
| 5      | Stars Day  |
| 6      | Sun Day    |

Asrian worship services are held on Sun Day, which is usually a day off for most. Devrans worship the Desert Goddess on Moon Day, after the sun has gone down.

##### Monthly Calendar

Because there are five six-day weeks in every month, each month's calendar is the same. Thus, every full moon is on the 1st of the month and every new moon on the 16th.

Table: Monthly Calendar

| Moon Day | Second Day | Third Day | Fourth Day | Stars Day | Sun Day | Week Name   |
| :------: | :--------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------: | :-----: | :---------- |
| 1        | 2          | 3         | 4          | 5         | 6       | First Week  |

#### Gallinean Holidays ## {.breakbefore}

##### Asrian Holy Days

The sixth day of every month is the first Sun Day of that month, and is
when most Asrian holy days celebrate the sun goddess Eserre. Devout
Gallineans are expected to attend church on those days, even if they
don't manage to make it to services on any other Sun Day in a month.

###### Winter Holy Days

6 Nivôse is celebrated as Winter's Dawn, and is considered the official
start of the winter season. Services in the Asrian churches ask for the
blessings of the Goddess-Empress Eserre upon the faithful, and ask for a
gentle winter.

The winter solstice occurs on 6 Pluviôse, marking the midpoint of winter
and the time in which Eserre's sun is out for the least amount of time.
Gallineans mark this date, and the two days around it, with the Winter's
Noon Festival – a time to come together and share warmth, food, and
stories, in addition to religious services.

The 6th of Ventôse is the third holy day of winter in the Asrian faith,
and is known as Winter's Dusk. Heading out of the coldest part of the
year toward the spring thaw, the Chaplains of Eserre ask for a
prosperous growing season. Tradition says that if a sun jay sees its
shadow at noon on Winter's Dusk, winter weather will continue into
Germinal, the next month. The Chaplains in Lutetia raise sun jays
specifically for this purpose.

###### Spring Holy Days

Spring's Dawn, on 6 Germinal, is a day of thanks for the end of winter
and start of spring, with churches and worshipers alike decorated with
flowers. The 6th of Floréal is Spring's Noon, the vernal equinox, and is
marked by outdoor festivals and dances around spring poles. Spring's
Dusk on 6 Prairial is holy day of peace, when even the most brutal of
Elara's armies will refrain from war.

Confirmation Day, 18 Prairial, commemorates the mythological wedding of
Eserre to her beloved Safira, the first Bride of the Sun. On this day
each year, young teenagers publicly present themselves as faithful
followers of the Sun Goddess and are henceforth considered as adults by
the Church.

###### Summer Holy Days

On 6 Messidor, Summer's Dawn, the Asrian high holy months officially
begin, lasting until Summer's Dusk, 6 Fructidor. The legends of Eserre
and the Qartan Empire are read or re-enacted over the course of eight
consecutive Sun Days, save for 6 Fervidor, the holiest day of the year.
On that longest day of the year, and the days before and after it, known
as Summer's Noon, the most lavish celebrations are held under the midday
sun. The most non-pious Gallineans will make a point to attend these
midsummer services, even if they will never enter a church or cathedral
the rest of the year.

###### Fall Holy Days

The fall holy days of Autumn's Dawn (6 Vendémiaire), Autumn's Noon (6
Brumaire), and Autumn's Dusk (6 Frimaire) are quieter affairs, devoted
to teaching, sermons, and service as the year winds down, the crops are
harvested, and the worshipers of the Sun Goddess prepare for winter.

##### New Moon Festivals

In addition to Asrian religious holy days, Gallineans also celebrate
ancient traditions associated with the Old Faith of the witches. These
folk holidays occur on new moons, in the evening when the sky is dark.
Most involve sharing of gifts and meals with family and close friends.

| Date             | New Moon Festival   | Traditional Gifts |
| :-------------   | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| 16 Pluviose      | New Wolf Moon       | Furs              |
| 16 Ventose       | New Snow Moon       | Wine              |
| 16 Germinal      | New Sap Moon        | Maple             |
| 16 Floreal       | New Rain Moon       | Boots             |
| 16 Prairial      | New Wishing Moon    | Lucky trinkets    |
| 16 Messidor      | New Berry Moon      | Pies              |
| 16 Fervidor      | New Kissing Moon    | Kisses            |
| 16 Fructidor     | New Peddler's Moon  | Handmade gifts    |
| 16 Vendemiaire   | New Harvest Moon    | Dances            |
| 16 Brumaire      | New Huntress Moon   | Game meats        |
| 16 Frimaire      | New Mourning Moon   | Memories          |
| 16 Nivose        | New Hunger Moon     | Food              |

The New Hunger Moon, 16 Nivôse, is a time for giving food to those in
need in the chill of winter. 16 Pluviôse, the New Wolf Moon, is marked
by the exchange of furs and warm clothing. New Snow Moon, on 16 Ventôse,
is a celebration marked by wine and other types of alcohol that have
been saved in the snow all winter.

The New Sap Moon, on 16 Germinal, celebrates the start of spring with
traditional meals of maple syrups served on crêpes. 16 Floréal is the
New Rain Moon, and gifts of boots and jackets are common as the spring
rains begin. On 16 Prairial, the New Wishing Moon is celebrated with
exchanges of lucky trinkets and wishes kept in secret.

The 16th of Messidor, the New Berry Moon, marks the beginning of summer
with sweet pies, tarts, and pastries. The New Kissing Moon, on 16
Fervidor, is a night for lovers to spend in each others' arms under the
stars, and is said to be the reason that there are more births than
normal in Floréal nine months later. The final folk celebration of the
summer, New Peddler's Moon, is celebrated through the exchange of
hand-made gifts given as part of a mock barter system.

The first of the fall festivals, the New Harvest Moon on 16 Vendémiaire,
is a night of bonfires, music, and dancing. The New Huntress Moon, 16
Brumaire, is marked by large dinners of game meats such as venison,
rabbit, or pheasant. On the night of 16 Frimaire, the New Mourning Moon,
Gallineans remember their dead friends and relatives, especially those
who have passed within the last year, through guising or mumming.

##### Devran Holy Days

The Devrans have their own holy days when the moon is a crescent in the
sky. The 13th of each month is known as Last Crescent, and the 19th of
each month is the First Crescent. Ceremonies are held on both nights,
and many Devrans fast nightly during the week between the two holy days.

##### National Holidays

Gallinea's national holidays are secular in nature and recognize
important events in the history of the queendom.

Treaty Day, also known as Betrothal Day, is the anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Scanbreille on 21 Nivôse 1241 – ending the war
between Albia and Gallinea through the later marriage of Prince Carolus
to Princess Mariana, the future Queen Mariana II. The 16th day of
Floréal, also called Espousal Day, is the anniversary of the wedding of
Carolus and Mariana in 1242.

Scanbrian Unification Day, 15 Pluviôse, commemorates the date in 989
when Scanbria became unified with Gallinea. Scanbrians also celebrate 30
Fructidor, Scanbrian Independence Day, which marks the date in 986 when
Scanbria declared its independence from Varendia. Many older Scanbrian
families still resent that the Grand Duchy of Scanbria lasted for only
three years before being annexed by the Gallineans, and the day is
usually one for political agitation. Needless to say, Scanbrian
Independence Day is not celebrated in the rest of Gallinea.

Victory Day, on 7 Prairial, marks the defeat of Varendia in 1123 by
future princess-consort Clarisse Sudelune, also known as La Dame de la
Victoire. The day is celebrated by military parades along the Rue du
Couer, both in Lutetia and elsewhere in Gallinea.

The Festival of Masques is held on 24 Prairial every year, and is an
annual celebration of freedom in Lutetia centered around lavish
masquerade balls, street parties, and excessive drinking. Anyone caught
outside of their home without a disguise is "arrested" and taken to the
nearest constable, who forces them to wear a cheap and embarrassing
costume. The Festival of Masques is also a time for much intrigue and
illicit affairs, as no one is whom they seem to be.

One of the largest civic holidays is the birthday of the queen. As the
current queen, Mariana's birth is celebrated every 19 Fructidor. The
birthday of her mother, the late Queen Elisse II, used to be celebrated
on 21 Floréal but is no longer an official holiday. Some members of the
nobility, who strongly opposed Elisse's policies when she lived,
celebrate only her birthday to insult the current queen.

The deaths of Queen Elisse and her daughter, crown princess Jehanne, are
remembered by solemn ceremonies on 22 Frimaire, as they have been every
year since that dark day in 1243.

30 Nivôse and 1 Pluviôse, the end of one year and the start of the next,
are secular holidays celebrated as Year's Dusk and Year's Dawn. These
are usually quiet days of reflection on the events of the previous
twelve months and a time to make plans for the upcoming year.

Diegan Playing Cards

Playing cards have been used in Elara and Ifran for centuries; they are said to 
have been popularized in the Qartan Empire by traders returning from Serica.

These cards are traditionally used for playing games of chance, skill, and 
bluffing, and are popular among people of all social classes in Gallinea.

Some cards are also used for divination purposes, usually adding an additional set of 
"Mysteries" to the normal 52-card deck.

Although most countries have their own variants on deck configuration, the most 
common type of cards are the Diegan standard deck. This deck originated in the city of Diega in 
Ondala, but during the Third Ondalan Tribunals all forms of gambling were outlawed. 
A number of less-than-pious Ondalans left the country to seek their fortune elsewhere, 
many of them joining the Ekalian trading fleets and spreading the Diegan deck around the world.

A Diegan deck consists of 52 cards. Each card has a suit and a rank. 
There are 13 ranks in each suit, and four suits in the deck.

The modern Gallinean names for the Diegan suits are Poignards, Calices, Bâtons, and Sols, as shown on the table below.

Table: Diegan Playing Cards

| Suit Name | Symbol  | Color  |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- |
| Poignard  | Dagger  | Purple |
| Calice    | Chalice | Golden |
| Bâton     | Cudgel  | Blue   |
| Sol       | Coin    | Red    |

The ranks within each suit start at Ace, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 -- the pip cards. 
The remaining three cards per suit are known as the court cards -- the Cavalier, the Prince, and the Monarch. 
The Monarch is the highest ranking card in the deck, although some games favored among the lower classes 
invert the traditional ordering.

It's common within Elara to decorate court cards with the images of the current local rulers, 
and sometimes neighboring rulers as well. If the local equivalent to the Prince is female 
(often the consort of the Monarch), a card painted with her image is known as the Princess and replaces the Prince in the deck.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Units of Measure

Various units of measurement are used throughout Elara and Ifran, most of which are based on the Qartan Empire's standardized units. 
The units on this page are those used in Gallinea, 
although there are equivalent units in most other countries descended from Qarta.

##### Length and Distance

The basic measure of length is the *pied de la reine*, or *pied* for short.

Table: Units of Length and Distance

| Unit                         | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :--------------------------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *pouce* or inch              | 1/12           | 27 mm     |
| *pied de la reine* or foot   | 1              | 32.5 cm   |
| *toise* or fathom            | 6              | 1.95 m    |
| *perche* or perch            | 22             | 7.15 m    |
| *arpent*                     | 220            | 71.5 m    |
| *lieue* or league            | 10,000         | 3.25 km   |

Different measures are used for different purposes. A *toise*, which is about two yards, is used for measuring depth at sea,
while a *lieue* is the distance someone can easily walk in an hour, or about 2 miles.

##### Area

The basic measure of area is the *pied carré*, which is defined as a square that is 1 *pied* per side.

Table: Units of Area

| Unit                            | Relative Value | Per Side      | SI Value   |
| :------------------------------ | :------------: | :-----------: | :--------: |
| *pied carré* or square foot     | 1              | 1 *pied*      | 1055 sq cm |
| *toise carrée* or square fathom | 36             | 6 *pied*      | 3.8  sq m  |
| *perche carrée* or square perch | 484            | 22 *pied*     | 51 sq m    |
| *vergée*                        | 12,100         | 110 *pied*    | 1,280 sq m |
| *arpent carré* or acre          | 48,400         | 220 *pied*    | 5,100 sq m |
| *lieue carrée* or square league | 100,000,000    | 10,000 *pied* | 10.5 sq km |

An *arpet carré* is roughly equal to 1.25 real-world acres, while a *lieue carrée* is 2,600 acres or 4 square miles.

##### Weight

The basic measure of weight is the *livre*, which is roughly equal to a U.S. pound.

Table: Units of Weight

| Unit                   | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :--------------------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *once* or ounce        | 1/16           | 30.6 g    |
| *marc* or half pound   | 1/2            | 245 g     |
| *livre* or pound       | 1              | 490 g     |
| *quintal*              | 100            | 49 kg     |

A *quintal* is just over 100 real-world pounds.

##### Liquid Volume

The basic measure of liquid is the *pinte*.

Table: Units of Liquid Volume

| Unit         | Relative Value | SI Value  |
| :----------- | :------------: | --------: |
| *demiard*    | 1/4            | 238 ml    |
| *chopine*    | 1/2            | 4.8 ml    |
| *pinte*      | 1              | 950 ml    |
| *quade*      | 2              | 1.9 L     |
| *velte*      | 8              | 7.6 L     |
| *barrique*   | 236            | 225 L     |

A *chopine* is about the size of a real-world (US) pint and is the normal size for an alcohol drink. A *pinte* is nearly a liter and
is a large drink indeed. A *quade* is about half a gallon, while a *velte* is two gallons. The *barrique* is a 60-gallon barrel of 
wine, beer, or some other alcohol.

### Religion in Gallinea

The queendom of Gallinea is explicitly Asrian in nature, although the degree to which
one follows the faith varies from those who only attend services on the first days of
each month to devout zealouts who urge everyone to comply with the Nine Precepts of 
*The Books of the Sun*.

Other religions in Gallinea include the followers of Devra the Desert Mother, Dodekarian
sailors and their pantheon of 12 gods, the relatively new Dualitiarian faith of Albia, 
and those who claim to follow the Five Brothers of the North. 

Although most in Gallinea don't think of it as a separate religion, the Old Faith of the
witches is a set of folk tales, home remedies, domestic ceremonies, superstitions, and other 
beliefs that are followed by members of the lower classes. These practices easily co-exist 
with the Asrian faith, with many who follow the Old Faith considering themselves faithful
Asrians. For them, the Old Faith isn't a competing theological and philosophical system
but "just the way we've always done things."




#### Asrianism

Originally worshiped as a sun deity by the Qartans, belief in the Goddess-Empress Ashra 
(known as *Eserre* in Gallinea) has spread throughout Elara. Asrianism is the state religion 
of Ondala, Gallinea, and Varendia, and the complex hierarchy of the faith is centered in  
the Ondalan city of Cordera. Asrian clergy are known as Chaplains, and are led by senior
chaplains known as Guardians of the Faith.

##### The Soleil-de-Eserre

The *soleil-de-eserre* is the symbol of the Asrian church, representing the sun of Ashra.

Four *soleils-de-eserre* appear on the Gallinean flag, and one on the Ondalan flag. 
A *soleil-de-eserre* is also found on one side of the sol, the Gallinean unit of currency.

##### *The Books of the Sun*

*The Books of the Sun* are a collection of Asrian holy writings penned between 1400 BQ and 300 BQ, 
centered on the teachings of the goddess Eserre. *The Books* are written in Old Qartan, although a
few unofficial translations into Gallinean exist.. The Nine Precepts are central passages in the Books.

##### The Nine Precepts

Asrianism is centered around nine principles, purportedly laid down by the goddess Essere, known as the Nine Precepts.
These principles guide devout Asrian believers, although the way that each is interpreted is up to 
that individual.

The Precepts are traditionally divided into three groups: The Three Professions, The Three Directives, and The Three Prohibitions.

###### The Three Professions

1. There is one Sun in the sky, source of light and life.
2. Light, life, and love are the Sun's gifts to us.
3. We are all of us children of the Sun.

The First Precept is seen as a basic confession of faith and dedication to Essere. 
The Second Precept lays down what Asrians believe are the basic rights of humanity:
to have light and warmth, to live, and to have loving relationships of any kind.
The Second is also the foundation for a philosophy of charity, making sure that
everyone has what they need for life. The Third Precept is a statement of universal
siblinghood and thus unity. Note that the Sun cares not on whom She shines, for
She shines on both believers and non-believers alike.

###### The Three Directives

4. Freely partake of only that which has been given to you.
5. Repay kindness three times, and harm but once.
6. Truth endures forever while falsehoods wither in the light.

The Fourth Precept has been broadly interpreted not only as a prohibition against
theft, but also other crimes against a person such as sexual assault. The Fifth
Precept calls on faithful Asrians to practice kindness in their daily lives, and
is also seen as a directive that any punishments must not be excessive. The
Sixth Precept teaches Asrians that honesty, both to others and to yourself, is
vitally necessary.

###### The Three Prohibitions

7. Let no man be superior to a woman.
8. Let no one own another person.
9. Let no one kill except to sustain life.

The Seventh Precept is perhaps the most controversial of the Nine. It has been interpreted as
everything from a demand female supremacy in all areas of society, to a rule on seating
etiquette. Most scholars of *The Books* believe the Seventh was written in reaction
to a male-dominated society of centuries past, and was not meant to imply the opposite, to declare
that women should be superior to men. The theological history behind the Seventh has had
little impact on the lay interpretations of the Precept.

The Eighth Precept is anti-slavery, and is responsible for the lack of an organized slave
trade of any kind in Elara. Most Asrians consider the Eighth to be the most unnecessary and
old-fashioned of the Precepts, since slavery has not existed for millennia. The Ninth Precept
is, like the Seventh, interpreted in a number of different ways, but all theologians agree
that Eserre is against murder. Whether the prohibition extends to situations of self-defense, 
to animals, to a state of war, to unborn fetuses ... is all up to interpretation.

##### The Matriarch

At the top of the Asrian church's hierarchy sits the Matriarch. The Matriarch is formally
known as the Bride of the Sun, regardless of whether the Matriarch is a woman or a man.
Legend says that the first Matriarch was a young woman who was literally married to Eserre in
ancient Qarta, and thus when a new Matriarch is elevated from the ranks of the Chaplains,
a ceremonial wedding is performed before the masses.

The current Matriarch is Isabene de la Justicia, the former Guardian of the Faith of
the Fuenta province in Cordera. She rose to the position from humble beginnings and 
accordingly urges those who follow the Asrian faith to eschew rampant materialism and 
instead offer communal assistance to those who need it. De la Justicia is not very popular
among the nobility.



#### Devranism

Worship of Devra, the Desert Mother, is all but banned in Gallinea since the death of Queen Elisse, 
but that doesn't stop the puritanical Speakers from representing their faith despite persecution. 
Preaching a gospel of strict austerity and rigid discipline, the Devrans claim very simple 
relationships directly with their deity and eschew the complex clerical structure of the Asrians.

##### Devra

The Desert Mother is also known as the Queen of the Night. While the darkness of night can hold terrors for those
in colder climes, to those in the blistering Ifrani desert the night is a time of relief, of 
activity, of renewal. Such was the context for the creation of the Devran faith.

##### *Songs of the Desert Mother*

*Songs of the Desert Mother* is the collective name for ancient poems, songs, hymns, and parables collected over
the millennia by the Devrans. Such scriptures are unique to each Devran, with a different set of *Songs*
based on one's ancestry, family traditions, hometown, and religious community. When two Devrans marry, one of the
most important tasks after the ceremony is for them to sit down and decide which parts of each family's 
*Songs* they wish to preserve within their new family.

##### Beliefs

The decentralized religion of the Desert Mother makes it hard to make generalizations about what they
collectively hold important. One Devran's *Songs* might focus on interpersonal relationships, another's
on agricultural practices, and a third's on punishment for crimes.

Basic principles common to all Devrans include worship of the Desert Mother on a new moon, a reverence for
family and history, respect for Devran traditions even if they don't match your own, and holding yourself and
others to strict moral standards.

##### The Lost City of Aad

Aad was once the second-largest city in the Qartan Empire, and is located in what is now the Ifrani Desert.
Legend says that the worship of Devra originated in Aad, and for this reason the site is still considered
holy to the faith.

Despite being known as "The Lost City", the location of Aad is fairly well known. The sobriquet refers to 
the vanishing of Aad during the fall of Qarta, and subsequent rediscovery by nomadic traders in the following
centuries. The personal names of those traders are not spoken in Devran tradition, but are simply known
as The Finders.

A pilgrimage to The Lost City of Aad that retraces the steps of The Finders, through rocky mountains and treacherous 
sandstorms, was considered to be a test of faith by devout Devrans centuries ago. The pilgrimage is merely
seen as symbolic now, and is not undertaken by all but the most zealous of Devrans. 

Those who do make it to
Aad find a humble village with a carefully maintained shrine surrounded by date trees nestled among the toppled
columns and walls of the Qartan metropolis. The shrine-keepers will allow anyone to pray there, but ask that
none stay more than a month before departing.

Modern intepretation of the pilgrimage say that each Devran will be tested repeatedly in her faith over
the course of her life, and like The Finders, the only way to make it through the rhetorical sandstorms
is by strict, unwavering devotion to Ashra.

##### Speakers

As a faith without an organized hierarchy, the Devrans don't have formal priests as the Asrians do.
Instead, when a Devran feels a calling from Devra, he steps forward and becomes a Speaker for the
Desert Mother. Historically, the role of Speakers was to urge villages and nomadic houses to remain
faithful to the Queen of the Night and to work together for the common good. The Speaker's role isn't
to be a leader but to be a teacher.

The role of the Speaker in modern Devranism is similar, although in non-Devran lands like Gallinea
a Speaker will usually become a community hub whether he wants to or not. The traditional role of
urging the people to remember the Desert Mother instead shifts to spreading knowledge of the faith
and agitating to change in the Asrian society that surrounds them.

##### Devrans in Gallinea

In theory, any religion is free to legally practice their faith in Gallinea, one of the key guidelines
in the Elissian Reforms of the last queen.

However, the practice of religious equality, especially that of Devra's followers, has been sorely tested
in the current decade. When Queen Elisse and her daughter Jehanne were murdered by a blackpowder assassination, 
rumors spread throughout Lutetia that tied the Devrans to the plot, even though there was scant evidence
to suggest such a charge. While some on the periphery of the conspiracy have been identified, the core
organizers of the assassination remain unknown, prompting many in Gallinea to pin the blame on the
quiet outsiders with their unknown practices in the dark of night.

Prince Jean-Remy, the queen's spymaster and uncle, has been conducting his own deep investigation into the
murders for years now. Of the key conspirators, he states simply, "They aren't Devran."

Lutetia is a large metropolis of over 550,000 permanent residents that
sprawls across both banks of the Luisante river and four islands,
overlooking Lake Luisante. Sixteen wide bridges reach across the
Luisante, each one giving its name to the surrounding neighborhoods.

Lutetia is known for its majestic architecture as well as its green 
parks. Landmarks include the Royal Palace, the Universities of Lutetia, 
the Grand Cathedral, and the Gallinean Library.

Lady-Mayor Lusienne Castenia, the countess of Castenia, is the current 
lady-mayor of Lutetia, and is renowned as much for her lavish formal 
parties as her political scheming.

### A Guide to the City

*description needed*




### Organization

The city of Lutetia and the immediately surrounding countryside are
ruled by the Queen of Gallinea as a royal province, but the day-to-day
adminstration of the city is turned over to the Lady-Mayor of Lutetia.
The Lady-Mayor (or, sometimes, Lord-Mayor) is appointed directly by the
Queen herself and serves at the Queen's pleasure, although it's
traditional for a term as Lady-Mayor to last for five years.

The current Lady-Mayor of Lutetia is Lusienne, countess of Castenia, who
has been in office for three years now. Lady-Mayor Lusienne is skilled
at playing the various nobles, guildmasters, and ambassadors of the
Royal Court off each other, preserving the interests of the Queen while
allowing Her Majesty to remain above much of the petty politicking.

#### The Bridges of Lutetia

Lutetia is divided up into 55 different *arrondissements*, or
neighborhoods, named after the 16 bridges that span the Luisante. When a
resident of Lutetia speaks of her location or address within the city,
she talks of arrondissement of that location. Lutetian arrondissements
are mostly wedge-shaped neighborhoods that reach out from the central
islands to the edge of the city.

The 17th Bridge

There are sixteen bridges leading across the lake to the great city of Lutetia. The saying 
goes, "For every person, there is a bridge" - all are welcome in Lutetia, be they nobles, 
commoners, Gallineans or foreigners. By the same token, if one is said to 
be "Seeking the Seventeenth Bridge", that one is someone who has not found their path in life. 
Such outcasts should not be pitied, for it may be that they will find their path - or, 
failing that, forge a new one out of the stone...
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are usually four parts to an arrondissement – the portion on a
central island, the bridge itself, the section on one of the banks of
the Luisante but within the Old Wall, and the corresponding region
outside the Wall. 

These sections are referred to as *sur l'île* ("on the island"), *sur le pont*
("on the bridge"), *travers le pont* ("across the bridge"), and *delà du mur*
(beyond the wall). Thus, a resident could speak of her home as being
in the "8th *arrondissement, delà du mur*", and her school in the "*7th travers le pont"*.

Some exceptions exist. Île Royale, the home of the royal palace, is
always just Île Royale, its own arrondissement. The 1st Bridge spans the
Luisante but not the islands, so the two sides are *rive ouest* (West
Bank) and *rive est* (East bank). Because of the geography of the islands,
there is no *delà du mur* for the 4th, 5th, and 12th Bridges.

Traditionally, addresses are given in Old Gallinean, although it's become
increasingly common among Lutetians to simply use the modern equivalent for
locations. It's understood when one says simply the ordinal name, the
"arrondissement" is silent. For example, "6th *sur le pont*" is a shorter
way of saying "6th *arrondissement, sur le pont* (on the bridge)." 

The following table summarizes Lutetian addresses.

| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| *sur l'île*           | *sli* or *l'île*    | "On the island"                       | *3^e^ sur l'île*             |
| *sur le pont*         | *slp* or *pont*     | "On the bridge"                       | Pont de Coeur *sur le pont*  |
| *travers le pont*     | *tlp* or *travers*  | "Across the bridge (inside the wall)" | 15 *tlp*                     |
| *delà du mur*         | *ddm* or *du mur*   | "Beyond the wall"                     | Beyond the South Bridge      |

Lutetian Idioms

Many Lutetian colloquialisms relate to the names of the arrondissements. As they are in
Gallinean but rely on knowledge of the layout of the city, these terms can be 
incomprehensible to outsiders. The Lutetians tend to use these as a shibboleth to
judge others' experience in the city.

  - Someone who is said to be *12 delà du mur* is someone who has escaped from La Roche Prison.
  - *4 delà du mur* is a Lutetian expression meaning "from outside of Lutetia," 
    and is a mildly derogatory for non-Lutetians.
  - Newcomers to Lutetia are often directed to the non-existent *1st Bridge, sur l'île* as a 
    humorous snipe hunt.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Features of the City

The most notable feature of Lutetia is the Luisante River, which flows
from headwaters in the northern part of Gallinea through the city, where
it forms Luisante Lake. The Luisante then flows south through the
country to Valerienne, where it empties into the Middle Sea.

Luisante means “sparkling” and the river mostly lives up to its name
until it enters the capital, where the extensive underground Lutetian
sewer system meets its waters. The sides of the river are reinforced
with stone walls that form hard channels to control the Luisante until
it spills into the lake to the south of the city.

The four islands at the center of the city are the oldest parts of
Lutetia. The first Qartan settlements were on the largest island, Île de
Lutetia, which was originally surrounded by a wooden, and later stone,
wall. Only a few signs of this original wall remain today, mostly in a
few random sides of old buildings overlooking the river.

The next largest island, Île Royale, is home to the royal palace. The
two smaller islands, Île Citadelle and Île Rocheuse, are named for the
stone castles that dominate each.

The Old Wall was built to surround the islands and the parts of the city
on the east and west banks of the Luisante, but in recent decades
Lutetia has overgrown the boundaries of the wall and expanded out
further into the Gallinean countryside.

Besides the two castles on Île Citadelle and Île Rocheuse, Lutetia is
defended by three stone fortresses ringing the city – La Guette to the
northwest, l'Arsenal to the east, and Le Puissant to the southwest. The
newly constructed Airship Tower at Le Puissant serves an important role
in protecting the city from aerial assault.

Four ancient roads, dating back to the days of the Qartan Empire, meet
in Lutetia on the central Île de Lutetia: Rue de la Rivière, Rue de
Scanbria, Rue du Coeur, and Rue du Sud. Gardens and parks abound in
Lutetia, most notably those along the entire length of the Rue du Coeur
on the central island – which is the scene for many parades and
festivals throughout the year.

The laws of Gallinea are enforced by the city's constabulatory,
operating out of small precinct houses around Lutetia and centered in La
Roche, a converted castle now used as a prison on Île Rocheuse. Those
who break the law are tried in the courts of the Palais de Justice.

## The Countries of Elara

Elara is the northern continent that borders the Middle Sea.
Technically it is part of the same continent upon which much of 
Serica is located, but traditional Elaran cartography considers
Elara proper to end just beyond Talania, at the Xhalxan Steppes.

The pre-Qartan people of northwestern Elara -- what is now
Albia and Albingia -- were a light-skinned, light-haired, light-eyed people, 
who came to the mainland from the Storm Islands. Gallinea's
indigenous population had medium-brown skin, dark hair,
dark eyes. Varendia and Talania were occupied by people with
dark hair, ruddy complexions, and dark blue eyes when the Qartan
legions arrived.

The rise of the Qartan Empire and its conquest of Elara resulted
resettlements of both Ifrani and Elaran people, to the extent that
in a post-Qartan world, nearly all of Elara has a mix of Storm
Island, Ifrani, Brigue, and Varen ancestry.

Unlike Gallinea, its neighbor Albia is a patriarchal society and has
been for centuries. Only a few queens have ruled Albia, fewer than the
number of Kings Regnant in Gallinea.

Located on the Albian peninsula, Albia has had periodic times of
isolationism and expansionism. In past centuries, Albia has controlled
land in both Scanbreille and Albingia in Varendia. The latter has always
been a sticking point, with both nations claiming sovereignty over the
north-facing coast.


#### History of Albia

The earliest known kingdom in Albia was the Mathac civilization,
centered around what is now known as Bear Island. The Mathains rose to
rule over a peninsula that was united for the first time, although it
lasted less than two centuries before falling to the Qartan Empire. Only
Bear Island itself escaped being conquered by the Empire of the Sun,
while the rest of Albia had its first female ruler -- a regent appointed
by far-off Qarta.

Despite constant, low-level guerrilla insurgency, Qarta's regents
managed to keep a hold on Albia until the Empire itself fell. As the
Qartan legions crumbled, the Mathains returned from their island exile,
only to find an Albia they scarcely recognized. Widespread Asrian
beliefs and Qartan social mores meant that the populace could never
truly be Mathac again.

The Reconquest of Albia, then, was more of a prolonged period of
cultural blending than an actual military campaign, eventually resulting
in a society that was not fully Mathac, not fully Qartan.

With the Reconquest occupying the attention of Albians for generations,
the world went on as if the peninsula didn't exist. During this time of
isolationism, intermarriage between the Mathains and the Qartans worked
to unite the country. Older Mathac customs, such as rule by a king
regnant, fit together with worship of Ashra, the Qartan sun goddess.

Established as a single nation, the Albians emerged from their isolation
to begin pushing into the rest of Elara. With Varendia in one of its own
cycles of disunity, the Albians were able to claim Albingia with minimal
military force, holding it against the scheming Varendish nobles for
over a century.

Albia faced more resistance when expanding into Gallinea; the first
Albian War led to a complete rout of the Albian armies, driven back deep
into their home peninsula. This would be the first of many wars between
the two nations, with the most recent ending a mere eight years ago in
1241.

Blocked from claiming more territory in Elara, the Albians began to
settle the lands of western Ifran, finding mostly cold and dismal
swampland huddling in the mountains of Ifran's Spine. The discovery of
phlogistone on land claimed by both Gallinean and Albian colonists
precipitated the start of the 20 Year's War in 1221. 

With both nations feeling the weight of two decades of war and Albia
suffering under the Elaran Plague, secret negotiations spearheaded by
the Duke of Bedyngford on the Albian side and Chaplain Farrazin, then
Gallinea's Minister of Peace, led to the Treaty of Scanbreille. The
Treaty arranged a political marriage between Princess Mariana of
Gallinea and Prince Carolus of Albia, the younger siblings to the heirs
apparent of each country.

Diplomatic ties between Albia and Gallinea are stronger than they've
ever been, as Carolus is now Prince-Consort to Queen Mariana, due to the
assassinations of Mariana's mother and older sister. However, old
rivalries die hard, and old war injuries even harder.

King Edgar and Queen-Consort Fionna still regret that they did not marry
Prince Edmund, their eldest son and heir apparent, to Princess Mariana,
as they envision a Greater Albia that stretches from the tip of the
Storm Islands to the Jeweled Coast. Under Albian rule, of course.

:::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
A Uniquely Albian Heresy

Dualiatarian is a religious philosophy developed in the last two
centuries, holding that the Goddess-Empress and the Desert Mother are
the same being. Dualitarians keep the hierarchical structure of the
Asrian church while adopting the stern moralism of the Devrans.
Dualitarian clergy are known as Pilgrims.

The Asrian scriptures, the *Books of the Sun*, and the Devran
scriptures, *Songs of the Desert Mother*, are supplemented by a book
written by Dackin Orwand -- the founder of Dualitarianism -- called
*Orwand's Revelation*. *Revelation* purports to describe the direct
equivalence between Devran and Asrian beliefs while reinterpreting both
to fit the theology of the Dualitarians. Dualitarians are sometimes
scornfully called Orwandans by members of the Asrian faith, but no
Dualitarian would ever apply that term to herself.

Dualitarians eschew symbology save for a simple horizontal
*cross-ordinary*, symbolizing the convergence of the Asrian and Devran
religions in a single faith; such a cross can be seen in the Albian
national flag.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Royal Family

Prince-consort Carolus, Mariana's husband, is the youngest son of King
Edgar II and Queen Fionna. Their eldest son Crown Prince Edmund (36
years old) is next in line for the throne. In between the two is
Princess Anabentine (33) and Prince Rupert (32). Carolus also has 3
younger sisters, twin Princessess Mariah and Esther (25) and Princess
Aurelia (21). 

King Edgar has two surviving younger sisters, Princesses Elizabeth and
Victoria. Princess Elizabeth has chosen to devote her life to the
Dualitarian faith as has her niece Anabentine. Victoria and her wife
have five children total.

Queen Fionna and her sister Lillian were the last surviving members of
House Warrington, a great noble family that was plagued by daughters in
the last two generations. After Fionna wed then-Prince Edgar she
arranged for her sister to marry a royal-adjacent cousin, Fitzwilliam
Bosevell. As Fitzwilliam and Edgar were particularly close, the formerly
Warrington sisters remained close as well. Lillian had six children
herself -- Fitzwilliam, John, Morgan, Matthew, Margaret, and Walter.



#### Locations in Albia

##### Dunon, Capital of Albia

The Albian royal family resides in Cadbury Castle in Dunon. Dunon is the
capital of Albia and its main entry from both Gallinea and Varendia. The
surrounding villages extend to the coast of Oceanus. The city is
situated on the bank of the Carlisle River, where it branches into the
Sterling River on one side and continues to the Great Sea on the other.
The Carlisle River makes the trade with Bear Island much more
convenient. Traders often make a day’s trip from the Island to the
landing at Gawain in Northern Albia. This happens so frequently that
captains often hire a crew for the crossing in one direction and a new
crew for the opposite direction.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### Bear Island

Bear Island boasts some of the best fishers in Albia -- excluding
perhaps the Storm Islands, which aren't considered part of Albia proper.
Bear Islanders also knit a brightly colored and tightly woven fabric
that is treated with sea lion fat to keep out the cold. This fabric is
in much demand in Talania and formerly in Varendia. 

##### Storm Islands

The Storm Islands are largely self sufficient and known for their
fishing prowess and use of sea mammal skins for clothing. While the
group of Islands trades among themselves and speak the same language,
each island tends to speak a slightly different dialect and have their
own traditions. One common tradition is *eilean bocadaich*, or island
hopping. Young people, men in particular, often take small craft from
one island to another looking for a marriage partner. 


#### National Classes

These classes represent unique facets of life in Albia. If your character is not Albian, speak to your MJ about whether
it makes sense for you to choose one.



##### The Huntsman

The hunters of Albia are known for their mounted hunting parties,
usually with the aid of hunting dogs such as the Albian spaniel. Bows
are the traditional weapons of choice for the hunt, but many in recent
centuries have shifted over to using firearms.

Many huntsmen of the lower social ranks hunt for food or for a
profession, while those from the nobility hunt for sport and for
bragging ranks.

##### The Pilgrim

pilgrimage to the Lost City of Aad -- although none are presumed to

| Pilgrim's Outfit        | 1D6       | --                | Capotain, cloak, buckled shoes, common doublet, craftsman's gloves  |

- **Albian Bulldog:** A breed of dog originally developed for the brutal sport of bull-baiting,
  most Albian bulldogs these days are rather mild in temperament except in defense of their
  owners. An owner can use the bulldog for a Brawl +1D6 Item Die in a fight.
  A purebred bulldog gives a +1D8 Item die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian Hunting Outfit (Soldier 1D6):** The traditional hunting outfit of Albia is
  designed along military lines coupled with practical gloves and boots for handling 
  dogs and riding horses. 

- **Albian Spaniel:** This hunting dog provides an Explore +1D6 Item Die 
  when tracking, moving, or foraging on the ground. When
  tracking an animal on the ground, this Item Die is maximized. A purebred
  Albian spaniel gives a +1D8 Item Die instead, and has a cost of 1D8.

- **Albian War Mastiff:** Albian war mastiffs are a large breed of dog that were extensively used during the 
  Twenty Years' War between Albia and Gallinea. They are strong dogs with powerful jaws that were used as guards 
  and trackers.

- **Frostwoven Apparel:** A frostwoven item requires one bolt of
  frostwoven fabric in addition to the normal cost of the clothing.
  Frostweaving is a Charm, and thus a frostwoven item cannot have an
  additional Charm added; however, a frostwoven item has no Item Die. For
  each frostwoven item worn, the wearer can withstand sub-freezing
  temperatures for 1 hour before feeling the ill effects of such. In
  addition, each item reduces the Drop penalty for cold weather by 1.

- **Greatbow:** Even larger than a standard longbow, an Albian greatbow
  requires more physical strength to use, but also provides a much longer
  effective range. It's less effective at close range, however.


Table: Albian Greatbow

| Weapon   | Hands Required | Prowess | Specialties | Ranges                                                         |
| :------- | :------------- | :------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Greatbow | Two            | Bow     | Aim         | Close (Drop 2), Short (Drop 0), Medium (Drop 0), Long (Drop 1) |

- **Hunting horn:** This horn is rarely used to play actual music, but instead is
  used for sending signals between hunters and their hunting hounds, usually in 
  fox hunting. A skilled huntsman can communicate over a range of up to one league.

- ***Orwand's Revelation:*** A book written by Dackin Orwand of Albia that claims Devra the Desert Mother and Ashra the Goddess-Empress are two 
  aspects of the same deity. Along with *The Books of the Sun* and *The Songs of the Desert Mother*, it is one of the holy books of Dualitarianism,
  and is specifically used to interpret those two books in accordance with Dualitarian theology. It provides a Scholarship +1D8 Item Die
  for topics related to Dualitarianism, and gives a Drop One penalty on rolls related to Asrianism or Devranism.

- **Pilgrim's Outfit:** The plain, ordinary clothes of the pilgrim are meant to
  convey a somber seriousness as well as humility. As such, it's almost unheard of
  for a pilgrim's outfit to be charmwoven, and nearly all are of neutral colors
  (white, brown, black, or grey).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: sidebar ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Talanian Refugees

Former inhabitants of Talania, fleeing from the encroachment of the
Shattering Frost, have flooded the northern and central parts of
Dragosa. These immigrants are seen to threaten the multicultural nature
of Dragosa by lack of fluency in Ekalian and Varendish, and as such are
limited in what roles they can play in Dragosan society. With the
inability to return to their ancestral homelands, the Talanian refugees
are at risk of becoming a permanent lower class within Dragosa.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### National Classes

These classes represent unique facets of life in Dragosa. If your character is not Dragosan, speak to your MJ about whether
it makes sense for you to choose one.



##### The Hanaster

Dragosan merchants do a lot of trade both within and outside of Dragosa,
with many willing to travel quite far in order to earn gold dragas.
Serica, the Coffee Coast, Mwene Karanga, the Storm Islands -- nowhere is
too far to go if a profit can still be turned by the journey. The
highest ranking merchants are part of the Hanaster guilds, and are
effectively nobility within Dragosan cities.

Hanasters are skilled at turning a profit, knowing what is most valuable
at any given location and where it can be acquired for the cheapest.
Most train in the basics of self defense, if just to protect themselves
from thievery.

- **Suggested Classes:** Barrister, Charlatan, Constable, Courtier, Envoy, Explorer, Privateer, Provincial, Provocateur, Visionary

##### The Lexicographer

With a diverse, multilingual nation, the people of Dragosa are often
themselves amateur linguists. Some of the most respected scholars in
Volstok are found in the Institute of Translation, where they catalogue
words, rephrase idioms, transliterate classic works in other tongues,
and decipher fragmentary texts.

Field researchers from the Institute range far and wide throughout
Elara, Ifran, and beyond -- seeking to capture jkkke in the wild and
bind it into book form, for storage in their guild's libraries.

#### Dragosan Names

Dragosan names are drawn from the names of the countries surrounding Dragosa,
mixing a variety of Ekalian, Talanian, and Varendish names. Each Dragosan
has four names that comprise their formal name:

- a personal name, used in day to day communication
- first parental name, either parent
- second parental name, either parent
- a location name, denoting where the Dragosan either was born or currently lives,
  proceeded by *tol-*

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Two Dragosans are named *Hille Senna Zanobia tol-Faldra*
and *Flordiana Piero Stemid tol-Volstok*. They have a child born in Volstok 
named *Baldanca Hille Flordiana tol-Volstok*.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If the identity of either parent is unknown or hidden, then the prefix of the place-name
changes to *tal-* and the parent's name is omitted.

If the location of birth is unknown and the person is Dragosan, then *tol-Dragosa* or
*tal-Dragosa* is used. For foreigners, *tur-* is prefixed to the country name.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Hille's parents are *Senne Kels Caltuna tol-Dragosa* and *Zanobia Aladina tal-Faldra*.
This indicates that one parent is from an unknown location -- *tol-Dragosa* -- and the
other parent is from Faldra. The identity of one grandparent is unknown, as indicated by
the *tal-* prefix.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

An even more formal pattern of naming involves expanding the parents' formal names, used
only in the most important ceremonies and in legal documentation. 

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example*: Baldanca's legal name, going one generation back, would be 
*Baldanca Hille Senne Zanobia tol-Faldra Flordiana Piero Stemid tol-Volstok tol-Volstok*.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

More than two generations back is considered unwieldy as it soons becomes an entire
genealogy. However, this is exactly what the Institute of Ancestry, based in Faldra, uses
as an official identifier, known as one's institute name.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*Example:* Baldanca's institute name is 
*Baldanca Hille Senne Kels Caltuna tol-Dragosa Zanobia Aladina tal-Faldra tol-Faldra Flordiana Piero Warb Anzola tol-Tanna Stemid tur-Talania tol-Volstok tol-Volstok*.
While she can probably breathlessly recite this from memory, she would rarely, if ever, need to share this with anyone.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Needless to say, Dragosan names can be quite confusing to people from other countries.

##### Common Dragosan Namesa

When borrowed from neighboring countries, Dragosan names that were traditionally tied to a
certain gender become non-gendered. All names in Dragosa are considered appropriate for
any person, regardless of gender or the country of origin.

#### Ekalian History

Ekalia is a group of islands to the southeast of Gallinea; Thedis is the largest city-state and center of trade for the region.

The civilizations of the Ekalian isles were old when the Qartan Empire conquered them, with a history dating back millennia. Ekalians have no queen or king, but instead choose Electors from among their citizens to form a ruling council, called the Plenum. From these, the High Elector is chosen to rule over the island country.

Each island of Ekalia is its own city-state, with economics and politics within each controlled by one or more powerful merchant families. Ekalia is renowned for its shipbuilding and trading prowess; Ekalia controls the Inner Sea like no other navy has since the Qartan Empire.

##### The Parroteer

Parrots play an important in role in Ekalian sailing life -- they're not
just pets, but are trained to deliver messages between ships and even
cities. A Parroteer learns not only the ability to train these
intelligent, colorful birds, but also to decode the cryptography used to
protect the messages from being intercepted.

- **Suggested Passions:** Country, Friends, Loyalty, Love

##### The Sibyl

The High Twelve of the Dodekarian faith speak to their mortal worshipers
through signs and dreams, as they have for centuries. The priestesses
(and sometimes priests) of these very human-like deities are known as
Sibyls -- oracles who speak the words of the gods while in the grip of
the powerful Kykeon brew. While highly respected by all within Ekalian
society, Sibyls are prevented from participating in the Ekalian
representational government structure -- a Sibyl is expected to remain
apart from the secular politics of the land, although they may advise on
matters of faith.

- **Suggested Classes:** Alchemist, Charlatan, Charmweaver, Chirurgeon, Envoy, Explorer, Provincial, Virtuosa, Visionary
- **Suggested Passions:** Faith, Justice, Knowledge, Love

###### Sibyl Class Traits

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The island nation of Ondala lies off the southwest coast of Gallinea,
across the Ondalan Channel. Ondala was originally settled by the old
Qartan Empire, and the Ondalans view themselves as the true inheritors
of the Qartan golden age.

The city of Cordera is the head of worship of the Goddess-Empress Asria
(also known as Ashra and Eserre), and home to the Matriarch, the leader
of the church hierarchy. Faithful Chaplains from all of Elara come to
Cordera to train in the Holy College before returning to their home
countries for ministry. Other religions are officially banned within
Ondala.

Over the years, Ondala has been at war with Gallinea, Ekalia, and Albia,
but is currently in a time of relative peace with its neighbors. Most
conflicts arise over their aggressive colony, New Cordera, in West Ifran
and its conflicts with its neighbors.

Like Gallinea, Ondala is a matriarchy; Queen Ximena IV has held the
throne for nearly 40 years, and has been known for her many liaisons
with young women and men of the court. Her power is limited by the
edicts of the Church under the direction of the current Matriarch,
Isabine de la Justicia.

##### The Cocinera

Intrigue and betrayal are a national pastime in Ondala, particularly in
the capital city of Diega. As such, most wary nobles, wealthy merchants,
and high-ranking clergy employ their own private chefs to prepare their
meals. These Cocineras are held in high esteem not only for their
excellent cuisine -- renowned throughout Elara and beyond -- but also
for their loyalty to the people they serve. Who is better suited to keep
poisons away from an important person's plate, after all? A Cocinera
lives or dies on the trustworthiness of her reputation, and she'd really
rather live than die.

- **Suggested Classes:** Alchemist, Charlatan, Courtier, Provocateur, Virtuosa, Visionary, Witch
- **Suggested Passions:** Artistry, Family, Loyalty, Pride

###### Cocinera Class Traits

- **Skill Competency:** Culture, Medicine, Nature, Science

- **Bonus Gear:** Crafter outfit (artisan's beret, smock, craftsman's gloves, breeches, buckled shoes), 5 knives (kitchen cutlery), rolling pin,
foodstuffs (8 units), cookbook, choice of 6 barnyard fowl, 1 dairy animal, or 1 livestock animal

##### The Theologian

The theologians in Cordera, center of the Asrian faith, all agree on one
thing: the other theologians are wrong. Cloistered in their numerous
seminaries around the holy city, the students, teachers, and scholars
all believe very strongly in their faith, but argue incessantly over the
finest of details, incomprehensible to even well-educated laity.

These arguments often spill over into brawling fights, but as swords and
guns are not allowed on the seminary grounds, the religious scholars

#### Locations in Talania

##### Zamorov, Abandoned Capital of Talaniana

*description needed*

##### Talanian Valley

*description needed*


#### National Classes

These classes represent unique facets of life in Talania. If your character is not Talanian, speak to your MJ about whether
it makes sense for you to choose one.



##### The Skomorokh

Talania, before the Shattering Frost, had a long tradition of folk dance
in elaborate, colorful costumes. These "skomorokh" were more than just
harlequins, more than mere performers; their parodies and satires served
to represent the common people in the face of oppression by the
bojarynias and tsarinas of the court. By passing themselves off as
simple "clowns" or "jesters," the skomorokhs were able to tell truths
that the ruling families would not want to be spoken openly.

With the fall of Zamorov, the skomorokhs migrated with the rest of the
Talanian populace to warmer climes, settling in Dragosa, Gallinea, and
other lands of the Middle Sea. Unfortunately, the nobility outside of
Talania lack a cultural tradition of tolerating the dancers' antics,
leading to many troubles for skomorokhs outside of their homeland.

- **Suggested Classes:** Charlatan, Charmweaver, Courtier, Dogsbody, Provincial, Provocateur, Virtuosa, Witch
- **Suggested Passions:** Country, Justice, Love, Loyalty

###### Skomorokh Qualities

- **Skill Competency:** Culture, Streetwise
- **Specialties:** Culture (Arts, Etiquette), Defense (Dodge), Interaction (Inspire), Streetwise (Banter, Carouse)
- **Weapon Prowess:** Knife, Cudgel
- **Armor Prowess:** None
- **Social Rank:** Commoner (D0)
- **Bonus Gear:** Mummer's outfit (smock, pantofles, masque, hose, cape), musical instrument (Arts +1D6)

###### Skomorokh Maneuvers

- **Aggressive Mockery:** Spend 2 Style Points to set the value of one Banter die to its maximum value before rolling
- **Beating a High Horse:** When mocking someone of higher social rank than you, spend 1 Style Point to add Etiquette dice to a Banter roll
- **Boundless Creativity:** Spend 2 Style Points to set the value of one Arts die to its maximum value before rolling

- **Refined Reliability:** Spend 1 Style Point to reroll a Culture roll
- **Savvy Reliability:** Spend 1 Style Point to reroll a Streetwise roll


##### The Toymaker

The craftsmen of Talania were renowned for their skill at creating
lifelike dolls and other toys for children; eventually they began to
incorporate both charmweaving and clockworks into their most advanced
toys. Mostly unknown outside of Talania, they were curiosities only for
the richest of foreigners until the Shattering Frost. Now, as the
Talanian diaspora spreads throughout the Middle Sea, children of all
social ranks have greater access to these entertainments.

Toymakers are some of the few Talanian refugees allowed to ply their own
trade in Dragosa and in Valerienne without fear of reprisal from their
neighbors, as they rarely compete with any local industries. Toymakers
are usually among the richest within a given Talanian enclave, and often
become leaders within their communities.

##### Talanian Clockworks

The toysmiths of Talania have perfected the ability to work at minuscule
size, producing tiny clockwork devices and components. These are highly
valued by collectors in Gallinea and elsewhere -- at least, if they date
before the Shattering Frost. Newer devices are made with just as much
skill, but the talents of contemporary refugee clockworkers are not
valued in most of Elara.

###### Arcanimation Engine (power source)

Comprised of charms and clockworks woven together in a cloth-driven
miniature turbine, arcanimation engines are the preferred power source
for most Talanian micro-devices. (Mainsprings are a far second.)

An arcanimation engine provides just a tiny amount of power, but it's
enough to run the types of lower-power clockworks found in toys and
dolls. An arcanimation engine supplies power for one hour, then the
charms shut down to recover that power back over the next six hours.
After six hours, the arcanimation engine can provide power again.

The power supplied by an arcanimation engine can be only be used to run
Articulation, Calculation, Carry, Efficiency, Harmonicon, Measurement,
Miniaturization, or Movement components. In addition, the specific
components powered can be no larger than 1 gear space each.

Creating an Arcanimation Engine: The Magicks (Weave) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create an arcanimation
engine. You are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as
shown on the table
below.

Table: Arcanimation Engines

| Space | Cost (Gears, Fabric) | Minimum Ranks           | Power Supplied |
| ----- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | D0 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +1, Weave +1 | 1              |
| 1     | D6 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +2, Weave +2 | 2              |
| 1     | D8 (1, 1)            | Clockworks +3, Weave +3 | 3              |
| 1     | D10 (1, 1)           | Clockworks +4, Weave +4 | 4              |
| 1     | D12 (1, 1)           | Clockworks +5, Weave +5 | 5              |

###### Harmonicon (component)

A harmonicon component plays predefined music when activated. A more
complex harmonicon can play more than one composition, and a Computation
component can be added for even more advanced music generation.

**Instrument Types:** A harmonicon can include the following types of
instruments: idiophones (percussion instruments), lamellophones (jaw
harps and music boxes), membranophones (drums), chordophones (string
instruments and harpsichords), and aerophones (wind instruments).
Harmonicons can't reproduce human voices or any kind of speech.

**Creating a Harmonicon Component:** The Culture (Arts) and Science
(Clockworks) specialties are both required to create a harmonicon. You
are limited by your lowest rank number of each specialty, as shown on
the table below.

Table: Harmonicon Components

| Space | Cost (Gears) | Minimum Ranks          | Power |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----- |
| 0     | D0 (0)       |                        | 1     |
| 1     | D6 (1)       | Clockworks +1, Arts +1 | 1     |
| 2     | D8 (2)       | Clockworks +2, Arts +2 | 2     |
| 4     | D10 (3)      | Clockworks +3, Arts +3 | 3     |

##### The Engineer

Varendia has perfected the art of siegecraft: if your neighboring duchy,
queendom, or grafschaft is being uncooperative and holes up in their
keep, refusing to fight, well, you can just blow the walls down and walk
right in.

Engineers are experts at handling blackpowder and converting into
military use, as well as constructing and repairing other types of siege
engines. They can usually find regular employ in Varendia or beyond,
with such skills being in higher demand during a state of open warfare.

##### The Mountaineer

Surrounded by mountains on all sides save one, the nation of Varendia
has an understandable affinity for the peaks and valleys of the Lendine
and Tramalvane mountains. Mountaineers are found on both ranges,
engaging in lumbering or the raising of hardy goats. 

Most mountaineers consider themselves to above the fray of the patchwork
states that comprise the Varendian valley, not holding any particular
loyalty to "Flachlanders" and their petty squabbles -- although it's not
uncommon for them to hire themselves out as mercenaries when the heated
politics boil over into warfare.

## The Countries of Ifran

Elara's neighbor to the south of the Middle Sea was the original home of the Qartan Empire.

In modern times, most of northern Ifran is a vast desert, although this was not always the
case. Legend says that as the Qartan Empire grew, so did the desert, until finally the 
desert swallowed Qarta whole and the Empire fell into ruin. There's a grain of truth to the story.

The majority of Ifran is unknown to most Elarans, who only refer to it as "The Furthest South."
It's not really the furthest south. The lust forests of Mwene Karanga gave rise to an
advanced civilization known as Mwene Karanga.

##### The Faris

The nomadic riders of the Ifrani desert travel between Ubar, Pitdah, Aad, and other settlements 
and oases, in tribal groups. A mounted warrior from one of these tribes is known as a faris, 
whether they ride a horse or a camel. The nearest equivalent in Elara would be a knight or
chevalier, as another type of mounted combatant.

Far from being desert savages, a Faris is a well-mannered, educated equestrian or cameleer, 
trained in matters of etiquette and peace as well as war. A number of Faris have settled in 
or nearby Pitdah where they serve as light cavalry for the khedive -- himself a former Faris -- 
and guards for caravans though the desert wastes.

##### The Stargazer

Worship of Devra, the Desert Mother, centers on her role as queen of the night. 
The goddess is represented as the moon, while the stars are said to represent the 
spirits of departed ancestors who have gone before into the dark. This emphasis 
on the night skies has led Devrans to develop skills at astronomy far surpassing those of 
the sun-focused Asrians.

Most of these Stargazers are found in the northern Ifran city of Ubar, whose skyline 
is dominated by tall observatory towers that reach into the night. Within these towers 
can be found Stargazers focused on astronomical science, on reading the omens in the 
movements of the stars, on the development of optics and lenses, on navigation in land, 
sea, and sky, and other heavenly pursuits.

## The Colonies of West Ifran

Western Ifran is mostly cold, dreary swampland, separated from the rest of the continent by a row
of high mountains. Only in recent times have the Elarans taken interest in establishing colonies
there, due to the discovery of phlogistone.

##### The Collier

The western coast of Ifran was long thought to be a dismal, sweaty, swamp-infested strip of 
land devoid of any economic or military value, good only for dumping undesirables who were 
no longer welcome in Gallinea but who weren't quite wicked enough to execute.

At least, that was true until the discovery of phlogistone, a relative of blackpowder that, 
when burned, produces fumes with extreme buoyancy properties. While all nations of Elara contain 
scattered deposits of phlogistone, large quantities of the substance were found in the foothills 
all along West Ifran.

This has led to a large influx of prospectors, miners, traders, and others, flocking to Elissia in 
hopes of making it rich. Most return penniless after a few months in the humid hills, but some 
manage to cope with the sweltering heat and become professional Colliers. It may be dangerous work, 
but unlike most professions in Elissia, it does pay well.

colony of Elissia are banished criminals ... just most of them. Some are actually 
daughters and sons of criminals rather than exiles themselves!

Despite that fallacy about their origins, it remains true that Elissians are known 
for their lack of respect for the law. Many of these become Moon-Cursers -- 
smugglers who bring contraband in and out of the colonies by dark of night. 
While most travel by sea, dodging the fleets of Gallinea, Ondala, and Albia, 
a few take overland routes into or out of Elissia. Their name derives from the 
fact that a full moon is a smuggler's worst when trying to remaining hidden from the authorities.

## Distant Lands

While most Gallineans never leave Gallinea, let alone leave the continent of Elara,
they do have some knowledge of lands to the east and the south. Such knowledge is
limited and often highly exaggerated; Gallineans have a lot of misconceptions
about the rest of the world.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The country on southern coast of the Eastern Sea is known to the people of Gallinea
as "The Coffee Coast," but the correct name is actually "Kheffika." It's from Kheffika
that Elarans were first exposed to coffee, and the Gallinean word "coffee" (*café* in 
Old Gallinean) is in fact derived from the name of the country.

Apart from being a source of imported coffee, however, the Gallineans have no idea
what the Kheffites are like and what they do.


#### Kheffikan History

Little is known about the history of Kheffika, but linguistic similarities 
catalogued by the lexicographers of Dragosa's Institute of Translation
indicate an ancient connection between the Kheffites and the original
inhabitants of Gallinea, who spoke a language known as *Brigue*.

## Opponents

### Types of Opponents

There are several types of opponents that can present challenges,
both in combat and out of combat, for player characters. These opponents
are rated in terms of how important they are to the story: rabble
are at best extras, while minor opponents take supporting roles. Major
opponents, of course, can challenge a group of cavaliers as major
villains or powerful allies\!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: toolbox ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Using Opponents

Don't assume that all opponents are there to fight\! A corrupt noble,
scheming artisan, angry soldier, or even hapless rabble could complicate
the heroes' lives without even lifting a finger.

Use opposed rolls, such as a duplicitous politician's Deception vs. a
player's Negotation, to represent a duel of words -- trying to to
convince a court of one's guilt or innocence.

Don't make rolls against Standard Opposition for opponents, though --
you shouldn't ever be rolling against yourself\! Either find a way for
the player to oppose the roll, or just decide via fiat whether the
opponent succeeds or not.

Similarly, if an opponent is actually friendly and wishes to help the
cavaliers, use the rule for assisting to have them grant additional dice
to the players' rolls.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Rabble

Usually appearing in groups, rabble are faceless opposition who
don't present a major challenge to the player characters. Rabble have
the following characteristics:

  - D0 or D6 Competency die
  - Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die
  - Yield Limit of 3
  - Wound Limit of 1 (after taking 1 wound, they are Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D6/D6, D8/D8/D8, or D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +1 Specialty Ranks
  - Two Passions (D8, D6)
  - No Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point
  - Usually appear in groups (up to twice the number of PCs)

#### Stock Character

A stock character is one that has a tangible role in the
game but probably doesn't need a name; instead, they are identified by
their profession or story role. Characteristics of stock characters
include:

  - Competency die usually D6 (D8 or higher for elite characters)
  - Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die plus Competency die
  - Yield Limit equal to 3 plus half the maximum value of their
    Competency die
  - Wound Limit of 2 (Drop 1, Dying)
  - Attributes of D8/D8/D8 or D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties (or higher for
    elite characters)
  - Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)
  - One or Two Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point
  - Sometimes appear in groups (one per PC), or sometimes lead groups of
    rabble

#### Minor Character

A minor character usually has a name, and has more of
a background (and usually more skills) than a stock
character or rabble. Minor characters have the following
characteristics:

  - Competency die usually D6 or D8 (D10 or higher for elite characters)
  - Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die
  - Yield Limit equal to 3 plus the maximum value of their Competency
    die
  - Wound Limit of 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties
  - Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)
  - Two Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 1 Style Point, with a maximum of 3 Style Points
  - Usually appear singly although often found in groups of minor
    characters or stock characters as leaders, or as henchpersons of
    major characters

#### Major Character

Major characters always have names, and play a key role as opponents
(or allies) for the player characters. All should have complex
motivations and are built as player characters are built, with just a
few exceptions. Characteristics of major characters include:

  - Competency die of D8 or higher, and corresponding experience points
    spent
  - Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die 
  - Yield limit equal to 6 plus the maximum value of their Competency
    die
  - Wound limit of 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +3 Specialty Ranks (higher for elite characters); built
    as per player characters with experience points
  - Four Passions (D12, D10, D8, D6)
  - Three Style Maneuvers, plus additional if bought with experience
    points
  - Start with 3 Style Points, with a maximum of 6 Style Points
  - Are unique individuals in the world
  - Have full character sheets as do player characters

### Customizing Opponents

You can adjust opponents to represent other types of characters in the
world; for example, a Pirate Crewmember could be used as the basis for
an Ekalian Navy Sailor by changing her Passions.

Some of the ways you can customize the opponents listed in
this chapter include:

  - Increasing the size of the Competency die (from D6 to D8, for
    example)
  - Adding or removing specialty ranks (up to the maximum value)
  - Changing equipment
  - Upping the Yield Limit or Wound Limit
  - Altering the character's Passions
  - Adding, removing, or changing a Style Maneuver
  - Adding, removing, or changing a Language


### Rabble {.breakbefore}

The following characters could be used as opponents for typical starting
cavaliers (D6 or D8 Competency dice), or can be used as allies,
rivals, assistants, or supporting characters.

#### Creating Major Characters   ## {.breakbefore}

As key opponents in a game of *The Queen's Cavaliers*, major characters
should be created to serve specific roles in your game, such as a master
villain, a major foil, a powerful ally, or a respected mentor. The
recommended method is to build a major opponent in the same way that
you'd create a player character, choosing two classes and so on, and
then adding extra experience.

But sometimes you don't have the time to do it that way, and you just
need to create one simply. Here's how that works.

  - First, come up with an idea of what this character is like, and what
    kind of role she'll play in the campaign.
  - Pick five specialties which she'll use the most; perhaps Lunge for a
    duelist or Inspire for a chaplain. These are her primary
    specialties.
  - Choose another five specialties which are important, but not the
    focus of her activity. These are secondary specialties.
  - Finally, pick another five tertiary specialties, which are things
    she can do, but aren't central to her character.
  - Assign a D10, D8, and D6 to her attributes in a way that makes sense
    to you, based on her concept.
  - Choose how much of a challenge you want to present to your
    cavaliers; this will determine approximately how many experience
    points she'll have. Generally speaking, you'll want a major opponent
    to have about as many experience points as the sum of all your
    cavaliers, with a minimum of around 20 XP and a maximum around 200.
  - Consult the table, Opponent Creation, and choose one line
    representing how many experience points your major character will
    have.
  - She will have the listed number of ranks in each of her primary,
    secondary, and tertiary specialties, as well as competency in the
    associated skills -- plus Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and
    Interaction.
  - Assign prowess in two to four types of weapons, zero to two types of
    armor, and two to four languages, based on your concept.
  - Pick her social class rank, assign one or more outfits, and equip
    her with whatever weapons, armor, and other equipment makes the most
    sense.
  - Most major characters will have two to four pieces of charmwoven
    apparel, with a charm die equal to their competency die. These charm
    dice usually assigned to one of the primary specialties or one of
    the tertiary ones.
  - Choose four Passions, assigning them in order from D12 to D6.
  - Pick three Style Maneuvers.
  - Finally, if she has any additional XP as shown on the table, spend
    those on whatever else you think might be fun. Extra style maneuvers
    or specialty ranks in Initiative are always good choices\!

Table: Opponent Creation

| XP Spent | Competency Die | Maximum | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary | Additional XP |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 0 XP     | D6             | \+2     | \+2     | \+1       | \+0      | 0 XP          |

| 20 XP    | D8             | \+3     | \+2     | \+2       | \+1      | 5 XP          |
| 35 XP    | D8             | \+3     | \+3     | \+2       | \+1      | 5 XP          |

#### Example of Major Character Creation

Let's say you’ve decided you’re going to make a major character who is
an important baroness from Varendia; in additional to her political
position, she's also an accomplished combatant, skilled with sword and
pistol.

Looking over the list of specialties, we come up with the
following primary specialties: Block, Parry, Riposte, Vigilance, and
Aim. For secondary specialties, Lunge, Scholarship, Negotiate, Brawl,
and Etiquette make sense. And as tertiary specialties, Intuition,
Inspire, Strategy, Explore, and Carouse.

With a number of Affinity specialties, it makes sense for her to have a
D10 for Affinity, with a D8 for Verve and a D6 for Guile.

The cavaliers in your game are pretty experienced; most have a D8
competency die and have spent around 25 XP each. With four players, that
means that 100 XP is a good starting place for this major character's
abilities. However, checking the chart above, that would place her at a
D12 competency die; we don't want her to be too powerful, since she'll
have backup in the form of her loyal guards, so we'll go with 80 XP
instead.

This gives her a D10 Competency Die, +4 ranks in her primary
specialties, +3 ranks in her secondary specialties, and +1 rank in her
tertiary specialties. If she's going to use Riposte, which is one of her
primary specialties, she has a +4 ranks. With Strategy, she only has +1
rank.

Picking a name for our baroness, we come up with Ingunn von
Sicherheim, and then fill in the rest of her stats as
follows:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Ingunn, a Varendish noble, is a patriot first and foremost -- at least
when her pride doesn't get in the way. Ambitious and thoughtful,
she is a planner who involves herselves in a wide variety of schemes
and plots. While most are practical nature, some are more personal
and are aimed at avenging a perceived or actual sleight. 

She will particularly try to humble any cavalier who dares to show
her up in public, be that by turning down an offer employment, thwarting
her plans, or simply knowing or achieving more than her.

Von Sicherheim is a tall, 35-year-old Varendian of pale complexion and 
a long mane of red hair. She has a large scar from a rifle wound on
her left shoulder, but has no qualms about displaying this trophy
of war even at formal occasions.

#### Animal Attributes and Specialties

While humans have Verve, Affinity, and Guile as attributes, animals are
defined by the attributes Instinct, Ferocity, and Training. These can
range from D0 to D12, and aren't assigned as D10/D8/D6 as for human
characters.

Animals don't have skills, but each specialty is grouped under an
appropriate attribute. There is one specialty, Perceive, that is
classified as any attribute, and the Initiative skill has three new
Specialties that don't apply to humans.

##### Instinct

Instinctive specialties are those related to the survival of the animal,
such as self-preservation or locating food.

**Dodge:** This is used by most animals to avoid attacks.

**Explore:** The Explore specialty is used for tracking, finding
shelter, locating edible plants, or finding water.

**Feint:** An animal will use Feint primarily to distract, although
there are some faster animals which use it for attack.

**Flee (Initiative specialty):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can
Walk to an unoccupied area, and for 2 Initiative Points, it can Run to
an unoccupied area. None of the human options for Initiative are
available, such as Interpose, Reprise, or Seize the Initiative.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

**Prowl:** Animals that sneak up on targets, or hide from predators, are
using the Prowl specialty.

##### Ferocity Specialties

The Ferocity attribute is a measure of an animal's aggression,
determination, and fortitude. They're primarily used offensively.

**Brawl:** Animals use the Brawl specialty to grab hold of things, knock
them down, or pin them to the ground.

**Fight (Initiative specialty):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can
Seize the Initiative and immediately make a Lunge attack. For 2
Initiative Points, it can Seize the Initiative and make a Brawl or
Riposte attack. It can't use Initiative Points for any other purpose.

**Inspire:** Pack alphas often are able to Inspire bravery in their
packmates, but most commonly this specialty is used to Inspire fear and
scare off other creatures.

**Lunge:** This is an aggressive attack using the natural weapons
possessed by the animal, such as claws, sharp teeth, or horns. Those
natural weapons add their Weapon die to Lunge attacks.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

**Riposte:** Animals don't Parry attacks, but they might be able to
Riposte on a good Dodge roll or by using Initiative Points.

##### Training Specialties

Training specialties are things that animals must be taught or trained
to do. This usually means being taught by humans, but sometimes wild
animals are taught by other animals of the same type.

**Arts:** While very few animals actually create works of art, many
birds will use the Art specialty to sing.

**Block:** Sometimes an animal will have a tough enough hide or shell to
be able to use the Block specialty. This can also be used by animals
that are actually wearing some kind of armor, from horse barding to
spiked collars. The animal can add the shell or armor's Armor Die to its
Block pool.

**Guard (Initiative):** For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can Interpose
itself to prevent a creature from entering its area. For 2 Initiative
Points, the animal can make a Lunge, Brawl, or Feint attack against a
creature that enters its area. The animal can't spend its Initiative
Points on anything else.

**Husbandry:** This specialty is primarily possessed by working animals,
such as dogs that herd sheep or oxen that pull plows.

**Larceny:** Only a very few animals, such as ravens, can actually use
Larceny to steal objects. Naturally, animals can't make use of the black
market.

**Perceive:** This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the
skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on
as an Item Die.

#### Scale

Instead of a Competency Die, animals have a Scale Die that relates to
how large they are. Scale also determines the yield limit and wound
limit for the animal. For yield limits, "half Ferocity" means "half of
the die size", and "Ferocity" means "the die
size."

Table: Scale of Animals

| Scale     | Scale Die | Yield Limit        | Wound Limit                                       |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pocket    | \--       | 1                  | 1 (Dead)                                          |
| Pet       | 1D0       | 2 + half Ferocity  | 1 (Dying)                                         |
| Companion | 1D6       | 3 + half Ferocity  | 2 (Drop 1, Dying)                                 |
| Human     | 1D8       | 4 + half Ferocity  | 3 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Dying)                         |
| Mount     | 1D10      | 5 + Ferocity       | 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)                 |
| Mammoth   | 1D12      | 6 + Ferocity       | 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)         |
| Behemoth  | 2D12      | 7 + twice Ferocity | 6 (Drop 0, Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying) |

**Pocket scale:** This is the smallest category of animal -- one that
could be carried in a pocket. Examples include a rat, a songbird, or a
tarantula.

**Pet scale:** A pet-scale animal is around the size of a housecat or a
small dog. Too big for a pocket, it can still be carried in one hand.
Some examples are a trained parrot, a rooster, or a rabbit.

**Companion scale:** A companion-scale animal isn't quite as large as a
human, but rather about the size of a medium to large dog. It takes both
hands or arms to carry a companion-scale animal. Examples include a
goat, a hunting dog, or a venomous snake.

**Human scale:** Human-scale animals are approximately the size and
weight of an adult human being. Some examples are a war dog, a ram, or a
constrictor snake.

**Mount scale:** Animals that are large enough to be ridden by a single
human, or perhaps two or three with a tight squeeze, are mount scale.
Examples include a warhorse, a bear, or a cow.

**Mammoth scale:** Even larger than mount scale, mammoth-scale animals
include orca, hordes, and elephants. They take up pretty much a
normal-sized room.

**Behemoth scale:** The largest of animals are behemoth scale. There are
few of these left since the days of dragons (or dinosaurs; nobody's
quite sure which it is). The most notable examples of behemoth-scale
animals are found in the oceans -- such as a great whale or a giant
squid.

##### Hordes

A horde is a swarm or pack of similar animals that work as one unit for
game purposes. If 300 rats flood out into the sewers, you don't really
want to make individual rolls for all of them whenever they attack or
defend.

A horde has an additional Attribute, called Horde. This is a measure of
the horde's consistency and cooperation. All Horde attributes start at
D12.

The horde uses its Horde attribute as a Bonus Die in all of its die
pools. However, when the horde takes wounds, the Horde die decreases to
a D10, a D8, a D6, a D0, and then disperses. This replaces the normal
Drop/Dying/Dead effects of wounds.

Most hordes are mammoth scale, although hordes of larger animals (such
as sharks) might be behemoth scale, and smaller hordes such as a swarm
of honeybees could be merely mount scale.

#### Other Animal Qualities

Many of the game qualities of animals are similar to those of human
characters. These are some of the ways they differ.

##### Movement

A human can Walk 1 area, or Run 2 areas. Some animals are faster than
this, and some are slower. The Walk and Run qualities tell you how many
areas the animal can move using each type of action.

Some animals have special types of movement that humans can't do, such
as flying, swimming, or climbing. These allow an animal to move between
Areas in ways that most humans can't.

##### Senses

Many animals have superior senses to humans; these are shown by the
Senses quality. When using the specific type of sense, the animal can
add that die on as an Item Die to Perceive rolls.

In addition, animals can use their best Attribute for calculating their
Perceive pools, as Perceive is associated with Instinct, Ferocity, and
Training.

##### Weapons and Armor

Whether an animal has built-in weapons or armor -- such as sharp teeth
or a hard carapace -- or is wearing an actual weapon or armor --
barding, a spiked collar, and so on -- it works the same way: the Item
Die can be added to whatever skills are specified.

##### Maneuvers

Animals don't gain style points. They don't need them, so don't spend
any of their success points to buy style points. They don't even know
any style maneuvers anyway.

Instead they have conditional maneuvers that just happen whenever the
condition is fulfilled.

For example, a great shark has the following maneuver: Blood in the
Water (when attacking a target with at least 1 wound, add Perceive +1D12
to Lunge). This happens whenever it attacks a wounded target. No style
points, no limited uses -- just whenever the condition applies, it comes
into play.

##### Impetus

Animals don't have passions. They're just animals, and concepts like
Justice or Faith don't really mean much to them. Instead, they have an
Impetus -- or maybe more than one Impetus.

These are the urges that drive an animal to action, much as passions do,
but on a much more primal level.

Impetus types include:

**Curiosity:** The animal just wants to know what's going on over there,
or across the way, or what's behind the door. And it's not like
Curiosity ever killed any animals, right?

**Hunger:** All animals are concerned with eating, but those with a
Hunger Impetus will prioritize food and eating over nearly every other
activity.

**Loyalty: **An animal with a Loyalty Impetus is a faithful companion to
a human, usually its trainer or owner. They're a human's best friend.

**Obedience:** A domesticated animal with the Obedience Impetus follows
commands given to it. Not because it even likes the person giving the
commands, but rather because it's that well trained.

**Pack:** The Pack Impetus represents those animals that stick together
as a group, usually in some kind of hierarchy or family units.

**Predatory: **A Predatory animal loves to hunt. Not just because it
needs food, but because it's actually a vicious hunter that likes to
track down its prey.

**Survival: **This is the most basic Impetus: the animal wants to stay
alive. It will take any action necessary to do so, with the only
exception being if it has a higher rated Impetus of another kind.

**Territory:** A territorial animal will likely attack, or at least
attempt to frighten off, other creatures that come within its territory.

You can use Impetus as you would use Passions -- an animal can use each
Impetus it possesses once in a story, and then it loses that specific
Impetus. You can only use an Impetus if the animal's actions are
directly related to that Impetus.

For example, if an animal has a Survival (D6) Impetus, you can add that
Bonus Die once to a Dodge pool or other defensive roll. A Predatory
Impetus could be used for tracking or spotting something, an Obedience
Impetus for staying alert, or a Curiosity Impetus for staying hidden
while investigating some shiny new thing.

of danger, but if they get hungry enough they can tear a person to
shreds. Urban myths speak of someone known as the Queen of Rats who
lives in the sewers beneath Lutetia, but that's just an old tale meant
to scare children, isn't it...?
