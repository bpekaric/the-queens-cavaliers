<h1 id="the-queens-cavaliers">The Queen’s Cavaliers</h1>
<p><em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> is a swashbuckling, clockpunk tabletop roleplaying game inspired by <em>The Three Musketeers</em>.</p>
<p>It features a diverse setting and unique game mechanics.</p>
<p>The manuscript is in the process of being added to this github site in Markdown (github-flavored), and will soon be available in HTML, PDF, and other formats.</p>
<p>The game mechanics are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<h3 id="character-creation-overview">Character Creation Overview</h3>
<p>To make your own character for <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, follow these instructions while filling out the character sheet.</p>
<h4 id="competency-die-xp-yield-limit">0. Competency Die, XP, &amp; Yield Limit</h4>
<p>As a starting character, you have a D6 competency die and you start with 0 XP earned, 0 XP spent. Your Yield Limit equals the maximum value of your Competency Die plus 3, so 9 for a starting character.</p>
<h4 id="choose-two-classes">1. Choose Two Classes</h4>
<p>Your character is a composite of two classes. For each class chosen, record the following information:</p>
<h5 id="a.-skills-specialty-ranks">A. Skills &amp; Specialty Ranks</h5>
<p>Your classes determine your starting Skill Competency and your Specialty ranks. For each skill listed, check the corresponding box to indicate Competency. For each Specialty listed, place a +1 in the appropriate blank space; if both classes give ranks in a specialty, write +2.</p>
<h5 id="b.-weapon-armor-prowess">B. Weapon &amp; Armor Prowess</h5>
<p>Your Weapon prowess &amp; Armor prowess are the total of those granted by your two classes. Check the boxes on the character sheet that correspond with all of your Weapon and Armor prowesses.</p>
<h5 id="c.-social-rank-wealth">C. Social Rank &amp; Wealth</h5>
<p>For each of your classes, record the Social Rank and the die for each rank. For example, if your two classes give the social ranks Commoner (1D0) and Soldier (1D6), you’d write down “Commoner (1D0)” and “Soldier (1D6).” Also record the dice values on the Wealth section of your character sheet, along with your Competency Die. Your total Wealth Roll consists of those three dice together in a pool.</p>
<p>The social ranks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commoner (D0)</li>
<li>Soldier (D6)</li>
<li>Artisan (D8)</li>
<li>Noble (D10)</li>
<li>Royalty (D12)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="d.-bonus-gear">D. Bonus Gear</h5>
<p>Each class provides you with a set of clothing and possibly additional equipment.</p>
<h5 id="e.-style-maneuvers">E. Style Maneuvers</h5>
<p>Choose one Style Maneuver from each class and record it on your character sheet.</p>
<h4 id="attributes">2. Attributes</h4>
<p>Your attributes are Verve, Affinity, and Guile. Assign one of them the value D10, another one D8, and the last D6, and write those in the appropriate boxes. You probably want to put the D10 in the attribute that corresponds to the column where you have the most Specialty ranks, but it’s not required.</p>
<h4 id="nationality-languages">3. Nationality &amp; Languages</h4>
<p>Choose and record your nationality.</p>
<p>If you are from Gallinea, you speak and read Gallinean; if not, you speak your native language automatically and don’t know Gallinean (you’ll need to learn it with one of your customizations; see step 10). For each prowess rank you have in Culture (Scholarship), you speak and read an additional language. Record each language that you know.</p>
<h4 id="passions-personifications">4. Passions &amp; Personifications</h4>
<p>Choose four Passions for your character that describe what she feels is important in her life. The standard Passions are Artistry, Church, Country, Faith, Family, Friends, Justice, Knowledge, Love, Loyalty, Lust, Pride, and Wealth. You will rank your four chosen Passions from D12 (the strongest) to D6 (the weakest).</p>
<p><em>Optional:</em> For each Passion, name one person associated with that passion and record that person’s name to the right of the Passion. This is the person (living or dead) whom your character most closely associates with that Passion, either positively or negatively. You can use an existing NPC (or even PC), or name a new one.</p>
<h4 id="customizations">5. Customizations</h4>
<p>You get to choose up to six customizations for your character. Choose your six customizations from the following list (you can choose each customization more than once):</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase one of your Social Rank values by one step; you can increase each Social Rank die only once.</li>
<li>Add one Weapon or Armor Prowess.</li>
<li>Add a new Language.</li>
<li>Add one Skill Competency.</li>
<li>Add +1 rank in a Specialty, to a maximum of +2.</li>
<li>Add a Style Maneuver from either of your classes or from your Nationality.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-equipment">6. Additional Equipment</h4>
<p>You begin with bonus gear as determined by your class listings. You also get your choice of one weapon: Knife, Pistol, or Sword.</p>
<p>You begin the game with three Rewards – one of them equal to your Competency Die, and the other two equal to your Social Rank Dice. You can buy additional equipment by using these Rewards – for example, a D8 Reward can be used to purchase any item of cost D8 or lower.</p>
<p>If you don’t want any of your starting gear, you can sell it back and gain an equivalent Barter Die. For example, if you don’t want a musket (Cost: 1D10), you can trade it in for one D10 Barter Die. You can’t make any Purchase rolls or use your Barter Dice during character creation, but you can spend your Rewards.</p>
<h4 id="character-details">7. Character Details</h4>
<p>Write down a name, gender, and other biographical data for your character. Write down two or three words for your character’s Reputation, such as “Fearsome Opponent,” “Mostly Harmless,” or “Renowned Lover.” Your reputation need not be true.</p>
<h3 id="passions">Passions</h3>
<p>Characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> are passionate, and their passions often spur them on to fantastic success or dismal failure.</p>
<p>Each character is defined by four Passions that are ranked with Passion Dice, from D12 at the highest, down to D10, D8, and D6 at the lowest. The size of each Passion Die indicates the relative strength of that Passion in the character’s life.</p>
<p>You must always have one passion at D12, one at D10, one at D8, and one at D6, and they must all be different Passions. (You can’t double up with the same Passion with two different dice sizes.)</p>
<p>In addition, each of your Passions is embodied by another character, living or dead, as the Personification of that Passion in your character’s mind.</p>
<h4 id="using-passions">Using Passions</h4>
<p>You can use your character’s Passions when roleplaying, by making decisions that reflect the role her Passions play in her thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition, Passions can also be used with Style Points for game benefits. Passions can be used in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indulge your Passion during a scene to gain 1 Style Point.</li>
<li>Add your Passion die to a roll by spending 1 Style Point.</li>
<li>Struggle with your Passion to make it harder for you to succeed at something – and when you fail, you gain a free Style Point.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="indulge-your-passion">Indulge Your Passion</h5>
<p>During a scene, if your character takes the time to focus on her Passion to the exclusion of other activities, you can gain 1 Style Point – but only up to the normal maximum of three Style Points at any one time. You can only do this once per Passion, per session.</p>
<p>For example, someone whose Passion is their Faith may engage in prayer, while another person who has a Passion for Knowledge may engage in scientific discovery or reading a new book.</p>
<p>As with any time in which a Style Point is gained, you must describe how your character is acting with style.</p>
<h5 id="add-your-passion-die">Add Your Passion Die</h5>
<p>By spending a Style Point, you can add one Passion Die to a Dice Pool under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Passion must be related to the roll that you are making.</li>
<li>You have not already added that Passion to a die roll in this session.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to have a good reason why your success or failure hinges on your character’s Passion – for example, perhaps your character is motivated to succeed because of her sense of Pride, or her desire for more Wealth. If you can’t justify how your character’s Passion would influence the outcome, you can’t spend the Style Point and can’t include your Passion Die.</p>
<h5 id="struggle-with-your-passion">Struggle With Your Passion</h5>
<p>Sometimes your character’s Passion isn’t a benefit, but is a hindrance. In such cases you can choose to struggle with that Passion by adding the appropriate Passion Die to the opposing Dice Pool when the MJ makes a dice roll.</p>
<p>If your roll then fails, you gain 1 Style Point and get to describe how your character’s Passion conflicted her and caused her to fail. If your roll succeeds, you don’t gain this Style Point.</p>
<p>You can only choose to do this when the roll is related to your character’s Passion, as with adding the Passion Die to your own roll; in addition, you can only do this once per Passion per session.</p>
<h4 id="inverted-passions">Inverted Passions</h4>
<p>Sometimes, one’s love for something can be twisted into pain. These are known as inverted passions; rather than being passionate toward the object of your Passion, you’re opposed to it.</p>
<p>You decide when you select a Passion whether it’s normal or inverted. You probably shouldn’t have more than one inverted Passion for a starting character, although your Passions may become inverted during the course of game play. (See “Changing Passions”, below.)</p>
<h4 id="list-of-passions">List of Passions</h4>
<p>The following is a list of the most common Passions that drive characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>. You can pick from this list or write your own custom Passion.</p>
<p>Several of these Passions require additional definition, such as specifying the Country that you’re passionate about, or the group you’re loyal to. You can record this beside the Passion die on your character sheet</p>
<h5 id="artistry">Artistry</h5>
<p>A character with a Passion for Artistry is drawn toward things of beauty, be they works of art, music, science, or nature. Such characters are often either artists themselves, or patrons of the arts.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Countess Lusienne Castenia, the Lady-Mayor of Gallinea, loves nothing more than a grand party to welcome the start of a new play, the opening of a new gallery, or the arrival of an artiste from far-away lands. She has a strong Passion for Artistry, even though she herself is not artistically talented.</p>
<p><strong>Artistry, Inverted:</strong> The ugliness of your soul drives you to destroy things of beauty rather than cherish them.</p>
<h5 id="church">Church</h5>
<p>A character with a Passion for the Church is devoted to the hierarchy of a religious institution, most commonly the Asrian church under the direction of the Matriarch.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> High Chaplain Farrazin, Guardian of the Faith of Gallinea, is a very devout man, yes. But ultimately his loyalty is less to the teachings of the goddess Essere than to her church. Raised in an Asrian orphanage, Farrazin rose through the ranks to become the most powerful chaplain in Lutetia – and there’s nothing he won’t do for the Church of Essere.</p>
<p><strong>Church, Inverted:</strong> You despise all that the Church stands for, seeing them as one of the greatest threats to your life and those of others.</p>
<h5 id="country">Country</h5>
<p>Passion for one’s Country is usually, although not always, the same as a Passion for the ruler of that country. The Passions may conflict if one has Loyalty toward one group or cause who opposes the current government.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Baudouin de Longpre, the duke of Rhodope, is one of the rare male heads of a province. As the oldest child of his parents, who had no daughter to inherent the throne, he became duke upon his mother’s death. The Rhodope family have supported the Throne for generations; they were loyal to the late Queen Elisse III and remain steadfast loyalists to her daughter, Queen Mariana II. The crown is more than the head that wears it.</p>
<p><strong>Country, Inverted:</strong> Your country has done you wrong – either through deliberate malice or “benign” neglect. Your ire may be directed against all people of that nation, or just against the ruling parties.</p>
<h5 id="faith">Faith</h5>
<p>As contrasted with Passion for the Church, Passion for one’s Faith is less about the religious organization and more about the beliefs. It’s possible (and quite common) to have both Passions, or also to have just one or the other.</p>
<p>Devrans usually have a Passion for Faith but no Passion for the Church, because worship of the Desert Mother isn’t based around a complex church hierarchy as with the Asrians.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Matriarch Isabene de la Justicia, Bride of the Sun, is the head of the Asrian church – some say she practically <em>is</em> the church. However, her strongest commitment is to her deity and (ceremonial) wife, Essere, goddess of the Sun.</p>
<p><strong>Faith, Inverted:</strong> You reject the Faith that once filled your heart with joy. No longer a true believer, you work to convert others to leave that religion just as you have.</p>
<h5 id="family">Family</h5>
<p>Characters with strong familial ties have a Passion for Family. This can include one’s extended family and household, or may just be one’s immediate family – such as parents or children.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Prince Jean-Remy is not merely Queen Mariana’s favorite uncle, but is also Gallinea’s spymaster and head of Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Haunted by his failure to detect and thwart the assassination of his sister Queen Elisse and niece Jehanne, Jean-Remy would do whatever it takes to prevent harm to any of his family.</p>
<p><strong>Family, Inverted:</strong> You’re the one decent person in a family of terrible people – or perhaps the only terrible person in a family of saints. You’re determined to prove to your kin that they were always wrong about you.</p>
<h5 id="friends">Friends</h5>
<p>Some people are very faithful to their Friends and would do anything for them – even die for them in some cases. You can decide if this applies to all your character’s friends or just her closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Gabriana Secouriste is a young member of the Queen’s Cavaliers. Personable and easy-going, she makes friends easily and is slow to lose them.</p>
<p><strong>Friends, Inverted:</strong> You keep to yourself and don’t form any friendships. Why? Because at one time in the past, you felt horribly betrayed by someone you trusted, and it’s hard for you to call anyone “friend” again, no matter how nicely they’re acting.</p>
<h5 id="justice">Justice</h5>
<p>The cause of Justice is a higher calling to right that which is wrong in the world. The Passion may stem from an innate sense of right and wrong, but more commonly it is a reaction to some act of terrible injustice that has been perpetrated against the character or the ones she holds dear.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Andreos Grimani, the High Elector of Ekalia, began his public service as a member of the Vigiles Urbani in his home polis of Imera. He went on to become a judge, before retiring to enter politics. First elected to the Plenum 15 years ago, he became the ranking Elector of Imera, then the Senior Elector of Justice, and finally the High Elector – a position he has held now for three years. Andreos is known for his strong drive toward justice as well as his detailed knowledge of the laws of Ekalia and neighboring countries.</p>
<p><strong>Justice, Inverted:</strong> The concepts of fairness and justice are a lie designed to keep us all docile sheep. Flaunting the law through blatant displays of criminal activity is your favorite way to subvert the status quo.</p>
<h5 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h5>
<p>Dedication to the pursuit of Knowledge can be expressed through a desire to learn the truth behind mysteries, to explore the world, or to learn all that can be learned.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> As a princess, Mariana of Gallinea was much more interested in scientific pursuits and clockwork engineering than she was in courtly rituals and noble intrigues. She was a top student at the Royal Gallinean Academy of Sciences when her mother and older sister were assassinated, forcing her to take up the Crown. In truth, she’d really rather be in a laboratory than in the royal palace.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge, Inverted:</strong> There are some things that the common people were not meant to know. Only you can be fully trusted with these secrets, and you’ll do what’s necessary to stop that Knowledge from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<h5 id="love">Love</h5>
<p>Romance is the most common expression of a Passion for Love, although there are other types of Love that qualify. Love may be for a single person, or someone’s heart may be divided among many loves.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Prince-Father Michel Aubene, the widower of late Queen Elisse III and father of current Queen Mariana II, was very much in love with his wife, and she with him. When they first met, she was not impressed with the rich southern boy who came to “play cavalier” in Lutetia and guard then-Princess Elie. After she saved him during an attack on her life, love soon blossomed. Even the dark bonds of death can’t quell the love Michel feels for Elisse.</p>
<p><strong>Love, Inverted:</strong> Love hurts, scars, wounds, and marks. You knew you’d never love that way again, and now you’re all out of love. All you want is someone who won’t hurt you, won’t hurt you no more. But does that person even exist?</p>
<h5 id="loyalty">Loyalty</h5>
<p>The Passion of Loyalty is about dedication to a specific person or group. You must specify who is the subject of your character’s Loyalty if you choose this Passion. You might not actually like the people you’re loyal to, but this isn’t about friendship but honor.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Martine Deveaux was once a faithful and loyal member of the Queen’s Cavaliers, willing to die for the organization and those within it. After a disastrous mission with the Cavaliers where she was made the scapegoat, she turned on her former companians. Now a mercenary assassin, Martine hates the Cavaliers as much as she used to love them. This is now an example of an inverted passion.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty, Inverted:</strong> You can’t trust anyone. They might demand your loyalty or pledge it to you, but no one is actually faithful. Be on guard, for anyone may betray you at any time.</p>
<h5 id="lust">Lust</h5>
<p>The Passion of Lust is about following one’s baser desires, usually expressed through sexual pleasure. Characters who are Passionate about Lust can be flirty, teasing, or promiscuous.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Genevieve de Longpre, eldest daughter of the Duke of Rhodope, is renowned for her string of love affairs – most of which ended poorly. It’s said she has at least one girl in every port, and perhaps even more! Hopefully they won’t all meet at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Lust, Inverted:</strong> Actually, it’s about ethics in sexual relationships. You’re one of the good people, and yet the objects of your desire keep gravitating away from you and toward inferior mates! They’ll pay for making you involuntarily celibate.</p>
<h5 id="pride">Pride</h5>
<p>A Passion for Pride means a character is highly focused on her own dignity and reputation. Affronts to such Pride are met with strong challenges, as such things are not to be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Although only 13 years old, Prince Philippe of Gallinea has more pride than an entire village of Scanbrians. The youngest grandchild of late Queen Elisse III and nephew of the current Queen, he firmly knows he is the most important person in Lutetia, save his aunt Mariana. And sometimes even more important, he believes.</p>
<p><strong>Pride, Inverted:</strong> Life feels like a succession of failures, but that’s okay – you deserve such misery, right? The best you can hope for is to scrape by, surviving. Sure, it would be really nice if things turned around, but how likely is that to happen?</p>
<h5 id="wealth">Wealth</h5>
<p>Individuals with a Passion for Wealth are focused on the acquisition, maintenance, and spending of sums of money. Some come from poor backgrounds and wish to move beyond their humble beginnings, while others are rich misers who count every penny.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jennevive d’Angelet is the Duchess of Scanbria and head of the richest family in the north of Gallinea. She and her husband, Lord Gerhardt, are well-known throughout the City of Scanbreille for their parsimonious ways, although rumors circulate that she is saving up for a major purchase. What that might be, no one is sure.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth, Inverted:</strong> Money? Who needs money? It just leads to temptation. You give all of yours away as soon as you get it, usually to worthy charities or individuals. You might even steal from the wealthy to give to the impoverished.</p>
<h4 id="personifications">Personifications</h4>
<p>A Personification is someone who represents, to that character, the associated Passion – for good or for ill. </p>
<p>For example, someone with a Passion for family may think of her beloved mother who taught them how to hunt – or she could think of her overbearing grandfather who always demanded more than she could provide. Someone with a Passion for Country could be intensely loyal to the Queen herself, or could idolize a revolutionary writer from last century.</p>
<p>Personifications are a way to tie your character to the world and provide the MJ with non-player characters for you to interact with. A Personification could be living or dead, an existing NPC or a completely new one created by the player.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10, Country D8, Love D6.</p>
<p>Her Personification of Loyalty is Sir Pierre du Prowe, an older member of the Queen’s Cavaliers who taught her how to swordfight. Dani’s Pride is personified in her rival, Elise Raymonde, another cavalier recruit whose skill with the blade matches her own. For Country, Dani looks to the Queen of Gallinea herself, Marianna, as embodying all that is good and right in her home nation. And for Love, she can’t help but think of the peasant girl Hersent who she grew up with, her first crush.</p>
<h4 id="mjs-toolbox-passion-rolls">MJ’s Toolbox: Passion Rolls</h4>
<p>In addition to using Passions to earn or spend Style Points, you can have players make a Passion Roll at the beginning of a game session. Such rolls give hints as to what is on the character’s mind at the moment and a way to challenge that character’s motivations in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>To make a Passion Roll, a player rolls all of the dice for her Passions – a D6, a D8, a D10, and a D12. The die that rolls the highest indicates which Passion is in play for that session.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Dani has the following Passions: Loyalty D12, Pride D10, Country D8, Love D6. She rolls her Passion dice, getting these results:</p>
<p>D12: 5, D10: 7, D8: 6, D6: 3</p>
<p>The high roll is the 7 and it’s on the D10. Her D10 Passion is Pride, which means that Dani may face a situation where her Pride is tested.</p>
<p>One of the simplest things to do is to have the player’s Personification of that Passion make an appearance, or a story hook related to that Personification. In some cases it may not be possible – such as a long-dead grandparent – but even then, it pays to get creative. Maybe the character finds a long-lost letter, meets up with an old enemy of her grandparent, or even has a portentious dream about her ancestor.</p>
<p>The Passion Roll is a tool for improvising roleplay and shouldn’t be seen as a constraint on your storylines – you can make the result of the roll as important or unimportant as you wish.</p>
<p>If your style as an MJ runs toward planning instead improvisation, you can have your players make Passion rolls at the end of a game session and use the results to decide what plot elements to introduce in the next game.</p>
<p>In an ongoing campaign, it’s likely that the same Passion will come up repeatedly. You can ameliorate this effect by removing from the pool the die corresponding to whichever Passion came up in the immediately previous session.</p>
<h4 id="changing-passions">Changing Passions</h4>
<p>During your character’s life experiences, her priorities may change. After a game session you can make one of the following changes based on what happened during that session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap two “adjacent” passions, such as your D12 Passion and your D10 Passion.</li>
<li>Invert one of your Passions.</li>
<li>Revert one of your inverted Passions.</li>
<li>Change out your D6 Passion for a Passion you don’t already have.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you swap, invert, or revert your Passions, your Personifications may or may not change; it’s up to you to decide.</p>
<h3 id="style-maneuvers">Style Maneuvers</h3>
<p>This is a summary of all the style maneuvers available to player characters. Each class and nationality choice gives players access to a different set of maneuvers; these are the only ones that can be chosen at character creation.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-style-maneuvers">Types of Style Maneuvers</h4>
<p>There are three types of Style Maneuvers: reroll maneuvers, maximize maneuvers, and conditional maneuvers.</p>
<h5 id="reroll-maneuvers">Reroll Maneuvers</h5>
<p><strong>A reroll maneuver lets you reroll your entire dice pool.</strong> You can do this immediately after you roll, or you can do it after your opponent rolls. You ignore your original results and only keep the rerolled version.</p>
<p>Rerolling costs one Style Point, and you can repeat it if you have enough Style Points.</p>
<h5 id="maximize-maneuvers">Maximize Maneuvers</h5>
<p><strong>A maximize maneuver sets the value of one die in your pool to its maximum value.</strong> You set that die aside and turn it to its maximum value, before you roll. For example, if you maximize a D10, you set the value to a 10. Then you roll your dice and calculate your result as if the maximized value were one that you rolled.</p>
<p>The die you maximize must be one you include in your dice pool from the associated specialty or item die. If you have a pool that consists of 1D8 (Verve) + 1D6 (Competency) + 2D8 (Lunge) + 1D10 (Weapon Die) + 1D12 (Advantage Die), you can use a “maximize Lunge die” maneuver only to maximize one of the D8s from Lunge.</p>
<p>Maximizing a die costs two Style Points, and you can only have one maximized die in any dice pool. You can’t a maximize maneuver after you roll.</p>
<h5 id="conditional-maneuvers">Conditional Maneuvers</h5>
<p><strong>A conditional maneuver has a specific condition that must be met in order for you to use it. When you do so, you add the dice from one source to a different dice pool.</strong> Adding the dice from a second specialty doesn’t give you the Attribute Die, Competency Die, or Item Die from the second dice pool, but it does give you a number of dice equal to your specialty ranks. The size of each such die is determined by your attribute; if you have +2 Lunge and your Verve is D8, then you add +2D8 to another pool as directed by the maneuver.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any ranks at all in a specialty but you’re Competent with the appropriate Skill, you can instead add your Competency Die as another Specialty die. If you aren’t Competent with the skill at all, you probably made a poor choice for a style maneuver; you can add 1D6 to the roll instead as a Specialty Die.</p>
<p>Using a conditional maneuver requires one Style Point. If you meet the criteria for multiple conditional maneuvers and you want to spend the Style Points, you use as many such maneuvers as you like on one die roll. You need to decide before you roll, not after.</p>
<p>When you add dice from one specialty to another roll, that second roll also becomes a pool of that type in addition to its own. In other words, if you have a maneuver that lets you “add Husbandry dice to a Lunge” roll and you spend the Style Point to use it, the roll is both a Lunge roll and a Husbandry roll. This can allow for adding in additional style maneuvers as a combo.</p>

<h4 id="mjs-toolbox-new-style-maneuvers">MJ’s Toolbox: New Style Maneuvers</h4>
<p>As the MJ, you can create new Style Maneuvers that can be chosen by your players.</p>
<p><strong>Reroll maneuvers</strong> cost one Style Point and allow for one broad type of roll to be rerolled. For example, you could create a maneuver that allows a reroll on Wealth rolls, attack rolls with a rapier, or rolls that use one of the character’s passions.</p>
<p><strong>Maximize maneuvers</strong> cost two Style Points and allow one specific kind of die to be maximized. Any given pool can only have one maximized die. Examples of appropriate maneuvers include maximizing the Mount die of a mount or a specific weapon die, such as a pistol. Don’t make the maneuver too specific; that’s what conditional maneuvers are for.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional maneuvers</strong> cost one Style Point and let the character add dice from one specialty to another roll, but only under certain conditions. The conditions you choose should be fairly specific and not overly broad, but they should also be something that a determined player could use at least once per game session, if not more often.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative maneuvers</strong> don’t exist, period. There aren’t any Charms or Style Maneuvers that add to Initiative rolls. You probably shouldn’t invent any, either; that limitation is there for a reason. You can, however, create conditional maneuvers that add Initiative specialties to other dice rolls.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to decide which classes, nationalities, or other groups have access to the new maneuver. Perhaps it’s a lost sword technique only taught to students of a retired blademaster, or it’s commonly practiced by adult members of a house of the Ifran desert. It’s possible you might decide that no groups can freely choose your new maneuver, in which case players will need to pay the additional XP cost when choosing it.</p>
<p>Players, you don’t have the option to create your own Style Maneuvers whenever you want – but you can always suggest one to your MJ and maybe she’ll like the idea!</p>
<h3 id="experience-points">Experience Points</h3>
<p>Each session of <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, the MJ awards experience points based on the following table. If faster progression is desired – for example, in a campaign with limited sessions – the MJ can increase the rewards by a factor of up to three.</p>

You must have Competency in a Skill to increase your Specialty rank, and your Style Maneuvers can be chosen from your own classes, from your National Styles, or from other classes with the MJ’s approval. Your Specialty ranks cannot be increased beyond +2 until your Competency Die increases (see the following section).</p>

<p>Each XP spent typically requires one week of practice or training. This requirement can be waived by the MJ if you’ve already invested time and effort in activities relevant to your XP expenditure.</p>
<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>Your character in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> is a composite of two classes. Each class provides you with half of your starting skill competencies, specialties, weapon and armor prowess, social rank, starting gear, and style Maneuvers.</p>
<p>The various classes can be divided up into three basic categories: skilled classes, social classes, and fighting classes. These are shown on the following tables.</p>
<p>For the most well-rounded character, choose a fighting class and either skilled or social class; that way, you’ll be effective in a fight as well as outside of one. Duelist is a good choice for a fighting class, if you can’t find another that doesn’t really fit.</p>
<p>If you are mainly interested in creating things or helping people, you can choose one skilled class and one social class, or two skilled classes.</p>
<p>To make a mostly social character, choose a social class and a skilled class, or two social classes.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to build a character who excels at combat but not at much else, choose two fighting classes.</p>
<p>You don’t have to choose your classes if you don’t feel inspired; instead you can roll 1D8 for each one. Feel free to reroll if you don’t like your original results!</p>

<p>Each of these classes adds a specific cultural flavor. If your character is not from the listed country, talk to the MJ to see if you can still choose one of these classes.</p>
<h3 id="class-descriptions">Class Descriptions</h3>
<h4 id="the-duelist">The Duelist</h4>
<p>A Duelist is a swashbuckling swordfighter who lives by her wits and her skill at her blade. She may be a member of the Queen’s Cavaliers, or a rival organization, or may be a freelance fencer who runs her own dueling school. Quite a few actors have been known to take up dueling as well.</p>
<p>Duelist is appropriate to accompany any other class in <em>The Queen’s Cavalier.</em> As swordfighting is so prevalent in the game, the Duelist class is a natural choice for most appropriate character concepts. That’s why they’re presented out of alphabetical order here.</p>
<p>In other words, if you can’t decide on a second class, choose Duelist.</p>

<h4 id="the-barrister">The Barrister</h4>
<p>When someone is accused of a crime anywhere in Elara or wishes to sue another person, she will usually be represented in court by a Barrister. Barristers have special training in the law and court procedures, and are skilled at speaking before a magistrate.</p>
<p>Some Barristers work for the Crown and prosecute lawbreakers, while others can be hired by those with enough money – usually only the rich. A recent and controversial policy in Gallinea allows for the indigent poor to be represented by public defenders, paid for by the Crown.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="the-brigand">The Brigand</h4>
<p>While Gallinea and most of the Elaran continent are long-settled, that doesn’t always stop opportunists from engaging in banditry. The typical Brigand in Gallinea is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.</p>
<p>Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there’s a long history of folk heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the poor.</p>

<h4 id="the-chaplain">The Chaplain</h4>
<p>A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian. The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.</p>
<p>Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Achalia are also found as Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Achalian Islands. Devraist priests are known as Speakers, and it’s rare to meet a Devraist Chaplain. Dualitarian Chaplains are sometimes co-classed as Speakers, however.</p>

<h4 id="the-charlatan">The Charlatan</h4>

<p>Chirurgeons often wear black bird-headed Plague Masks when treating their patients; many of these are charmwoven to improve their surgical skills. Chirurgeons are not adverse to using magicks when appropriate, including alchemical remedies.</p>

<h4 id="the-constable">The Constable</h4>
<p>In the Gallinean justice system, the Crown is represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the Constabulary, who investigate crime, and the Crown Barristers who prosecute the offenders. The Constables – and their counterparts in neighboring countries – enforce the laws and protect the people from wrongdoers as well as capturing those who commit criminal acts.</p>
<p>Most Constables are employed by the Crown or a local province, while a few have retired and ply their trade as investigators for private hire.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="the-courtier">The Courtier</h4>
<p>Members of the Gallinean royal court, and other noble courts, are Courtiers. They are well-educated, trained in etiquette and social graces, and have preternatural skill for plotting and intrigue.</p>
<p>Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.</p>
<p>Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their leisure.</p>

<p>Veterans of that and other wars are well-trained in the art of battle, and if not currently part of a military unit, often join mercenary companies or guard regiments rather than settle down into a civilian lifestyle. - <strong>Suggested Classes:</strong> Brigand, Chaplain, Constable, Dogsbody, Dragoon, Duelist, Explorer, Fusilier, Privateer, Provincial - <strong>Suggested Passions:</strong> Country, Family, Friends, Loyalty</p>

<h3 id="variants-alternatives-to-classes">Variants: Alternatives to Classes</h3>
<p>You don’t have to make your character with classes; here are three options that you can try, with your MJ’s permission!</p>
<h4 id="option-random-backstories">Option: Random Backstories</h4>
<p>This is an optional method of character creation that allows you to roll randomly on a series of tables (or, with your MJ’s permission, pick from the lists) to determine your character’s backstory, starting skills, and proficiencies.</p>
<p>This system replaces the part of the character creation process where you choose two classes.</p>
<p>When you gain a specialty, you also gain competency in the appropriate skill. For example, if a result reads “Culture (Scholarship +1),” you gain competency in the Culture skill if you didn’t have it before, and you gain one rank in the Scholarship specialty.</p>
<p>As a starting character, you are limited to a maximum of +2 ranks in any specialty. If a random roll would increase your ranks to +3 or higher, the additional points are added to your customizations which you can spend later in the character creation process.</p>
<p>Because you don’t have a class, you can’t spend your customizations on additional style maneuvers during the character creation process, apart from national styles. (When you gain enough XP, you can take any style maneuver later.)</p>
<h5 id="regional-or-national-origin">Regional or National Origin</h5>
<p>Roll 1D12 to determine where you were born, your native language(s), and the skills you picked up at an early age from your culture. Alternately, if you know you want to be from Gallinea itself, just roll 1D4.</p>

<p>Dani decides to roll up a character using the optional random backstory system instead of choosing two classes.</p>
<h6 id="regional-or-national-origin-1">Regional or National Origin</h6>
<p>Dani rolls a 12 on the table, meaning she’s from Varendia. She adds the Varendish language and the skills Military and Nature to her character sheet.</p>
<h6 id="parentage-1">Parentage</h6>
<p>With a roll of 8, one of Dani’s parents was a retired Cavalier. She adds the Gallinean langague, skill competency in Dueling, one rank in Lunge, prowess with swords, and the style maneuver Confident Fencing to her character sheet. She also sets her D6 passion to Loyalty.</p>
<p>Dani also has to answer the question, “What notable deed did your parent perform in the name of the Queen?” Dani decides that her mother stopped an Albian airship from bombing Castenia during the Twenty Years’ War.</p>
<h6 id="pivotal-event-of-childhood-1">Pivotal Event of Childhood</h6>
<p>Rolling a d8, Dani gets a 1, and finds that someone in her family died. She decides this was her father, and that his unexpected death caused her to grow up quickly. She adds one rank to Intuition, and sets her D8 Passion to Family.</p>
<p>In answer to the question “What did your relative tell you before they died?” Dani decides that her dying father told her to never turn her back on someone in need.</p>
<h6 id="education-1">Education</h6>
<p>Dani rolls a result of 11 on the education table, meaning that she attended the royal universities in Lutetia. This gives her the Gallinean language, but she already speaks it. She also gains competency in Culture; one skill rank each in Etiquette, Scholarship, Negotiate, and Deduce; Knowledge as a D10 passion; and the Cunning Erudition style maneuver.</p>
<p>To answer the question “Why did a stranger pay for your expensive education?” she decides that the Duchess of Castenia paid for her education in recognition of her mother’s bravery during the last war.</p>
<h6 id="pivotal-event-of-adulthood-1">Pivotal Event of Adulthood</h6>
<p>Dani rolls a 1 on the final table, getting “Clandestinely Recruited.” This gives her competency in Medicine and Streetwise, and one rank each in Deceive, Prowl, Poison, and Carouse. She also gains Country as a D12 passion and Do You Expect Me To Talk? as a style maneuver.</p>
<p>“What have you learned that makes you mistrust your superiors?” Dani distrusts her superior because she has been asked to spy on her fellow members of the Queen’s Cavaliers.</p>
<h6 id="backstory-summary">Backstory Summary</h6>
<p>Dani was born in Varendia to a Gallinean mother and a Varendish father. Her mother had distinguished herself during the war between Albia and Gallinea, and when she had completed her duty to the Queen, she married a man in Varendia and settled down. Tragically, Dani’s father passed away when she was young and she was raised by her mother.</p>
<p>Dani returned to Gallinea when she was old enough to study at the royal universities in Lutetia, with her education paid for by a grateful noble who remembered her mother’s courage. Upon graduation, Dani was accepted into the Queen’s Cavaliers as a new recruit, and was also contacted by Prince Jean-Remy, the Queen’s uncle and spymaster, and asked to report back to him on the actions of her fellow cavaliers.</p>

</ul>
<h6 id="further-customization">Further Customization</h6>
<p>Dani is now free to spend her customizations to further shape her character to fit the concept she’d like to play. Dani can also spend her starting Rewards on additional gear (plus gets a simple weapon for free).</p>
<h4 id="option-playing-without-classes">Option: Playing Without Classes</h4>
<p>You don’t even have to play with classes (or backstories) at all. The MJ might allow this option if she wants everyone to have the most flexibility in creating their characters.</p>
<p>A base character starts with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill Competency in Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and Observation.</li>
<li>One language.</li>
<li>Knife Weapon Prowess.</li>
<li>Social Rank of Commoner (D0)/Commoner (D0).</li>
<li>One outfit and one common weapon.</li>
<li>30 customizations, replacing the 6 customizations that characters normally receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use those customizations in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Competency in any one skill.</li>
<li>Add +1 rank to any Specialty which you have the related skill competency. Limits: You can’t have more than +2 ranks in any given specialty. You can’t assign more than eight ranks to the specialties corresponding to each attribute (Verge, Affinity, Guile).</li>
<li>Add one language.</li>
<li>Add one armor prowess or weapon prowess.</li>
<li>Increase one of your social ranks by 1, to a limit of Noble (D10)/Artisan (D8).</li>
<li>Add one style maneuver of your choice. Limits: You can have a maximum of six style maneuvers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have assigned your customizations, you receive four rewards equal to your Competency Die, two rewards equal to your lowest rank, and two rewards equal to your highest social rank. You can spend those normally to buy your starting equipment.</p>
<h5 id="example-of-class-free-character-creation">Example of Class-Free Character Creation</h5>
<p>Morgan decides she’s going to create a character who is all about airships. She starts with the base character and then spends her 30 customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Competency:</strong> In addition to the automatic skill competency, she also chooses to be competent with Dueling (for mid-air swordfights!), Military (for mid-air gun fights! and airship tactics), Nature (so she’ll be good at exploring), and Science (since airships are pretty advanced technology). This uses four of her customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Specialty Ranks:</strong> Morgan picks Parry +1 (mid-air swordfights!), Dodge +1 (mid-air gun fights!), Aim +1 (also mid-air gun fights!), Strategy +2 (airship tactics), Explore +2 (navigating), Blackpowder +1 (firing cannons!), and Clockworks +2 (fixing a broken airship). She also chooses Scholarship +1 (mainly for geographic knowledge), Etiquette +1 (customs of far-off lands), Inspire +1 (officers should be inspiring, right?) and Perceive +1 (for looking through a spyglass). Adding up the totals for each attribute, she finds +6 ranks total for Verve (Parry, Explore twice, Blackpowder, Inspire, Perceive), +4 ranks total for Affinity (Aim, Etiquette, Clockworks twice), and +4 ranks for Guile (Dodge, Strategy twice, Scholarship). This is under the limit of eight ranks per attribute, so she’s good there. This costs 14 of her customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Morgan decides she will be from Albia, and thus her free language is Albian. She also gets a bonus language from her +1 rank in Scholarship, and she picks Gallinean. She decides to also learn Ekalian (because many sailors are from Ekalia) and Varendish (because the best cannonsmiths hail from Varendia), and that uses up two more customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Armor or Weapon Prowess:</strong> While she doesn’t think she needs armor prowess, Morgan does want to know how to use Swords, Pistols, and Cannons. She spends three customizations on those.</p>
<p><strong>Social Rank:</strong> Figuring that airships are rather expensive to maintain, Morgan pushes her social ranks up to the maximum of Noble (D10)/Artisan (D8). This uses five of her customizations, and she’s only got two left from the original 30.</p>
<p><strong>Style Maneuvers:</strong> Looking over the list of style maneuvers in Chapter 5, Morgan finds two that thinks will be most appropriate for a future air-captain like herself. She selects Powdersmith (when creating or repairing a device with a blackpowder flintlock power source, a phlogistone furnace power source, or an explosion component, spend 1 Style Point to add Blackpowder dice to a Clockworks roll) and Naval Hilt (when using a cutlass, spend 1 Style Point to add Explore dice to a Parry roll). This uses up her last two customizations.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Naturally, Morgan chooses to start with a corsair outfit, and for her free weapon chooses a cutlass. She receives rewards of 4D6 (from her Competency Die), 2D8 (her Artisan social rank) and 1D10 (her Noble social rank). It’s not quite enough to buy an airship, so she instead buys a cutlass (1D6 cost), a mariner’s astrolabe (1D6 cost), a spyglass (1D6 cost), repair tools (1D6 cost), a double pistol (1D8 cost) because it’s cool, and a deck cannon (1D10 cost) since she always wanted a cannon. Doesn’t everyone? This leaves her with a 1D8 reward, which she chooses to spend on four supplies of clockwork gears so she can repair an airship or make nifty toys.</p>
<h4 id="option-creating-a-custom-class">Option: Creating a Custom Class</h4>
<p>If only one of the classes appeals to you, you can create a custom class with the MJ’s consent. (Having two custom classes is not recommended; choose one standard class in addition to your custom class.)</p>
<p>Make the following choices and write them down:</p>
<p><strong>Name and Description:</strong> Decide what role the class will play in Gallinean, Elaran, or Ifran society. How is this class different from existing classes?</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Classes and Passions:</strong> Choose at least 3 suggested classes and passions that fit the class concept. <strong>Limit:</strong> You can’t choose Duelist as one of the classes.</p>
<p><strong>Social Rank:</strong> If the class is primarily focused on combat, then the Social Rank should be Soldier (D6). If the class requires formal education or apprenticeship, then the Social Rank should be Artisan (D8). Otherwise the class should probably be Commoner (D0). <strong>Limit:</strong> A custom class can’t be Noble (D10) or Royal (D12) social rank.</p>
<p><strong>Specialties and Skill Competency:</strong> Choose six different specialties that make sense for the class; these all gain +1. The Skill Competencies correspond to those specialties, with the exception of skills that everyone is already competent in using. <strong>Limits:</strong> Classes never give specialty ranks in Initiative. Each attribute (Verve, Affinity, Guile) can have at most 3 specialties associated with it.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Prowess:</strong> If the class would know how to use specific weapons or armor types, pick up to four of those, total. Remember that everyone already knows how to use a Knife.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Gear:</strong> Choose one outfit that the class will receive for free. If the class requires the use of one or more tools, pick one of those tools as well as 4 supplies of the appropriate type. If the class has weapon or armor prowess, choose up one weapon and one type of armor. Remember that everyone gets one common weapon for free.</p>
<p><strong>Style Maneuvers: </strong>Choose six style maneuvers from the list of style maneuvers that are appropriate for this class: two that allow a reroll of one skill, two that allow one die to be maximized on a specialty roll, and two that let you add dice from one pool to another under specific circumstances.</p>
<p>When you’ve finished creating your class, let your MJ review it to see if it fits her concept of the world and the campaign. She can provide suggestions on how you can modify the class if she sees potential problems with the class.</p>
<h6 id="mj-created-classes">MJ-Created Classes</h6>
<p>MJs, you can create classes too, and offer them as additional choices for your players. You should try to follow the general guidelines given for players, although you can customize the social rank, bonus gear, armor prowess, and weapon prowess. You shouldn’t give a class specialty ranks in Initiative, and a class shouldn’t have more than 8 style maneuvers.</p>
<h2 id="skills-and-specialties">Skills and Specialties</h2>
<p>There are 12 skills in The Queen’s Cavaliers, ranging from Culture to Streetwise. Each of these skills has three specialties, corresponding to the three Attributes of Verve, Affinity, and Guile.</p>
<h4 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h4>
<p>To use a skill, first you determine under which specialty the task you want to perform falls. Your dice pool starts with one die of that specialty’s corresponding attribute; this is your Attribute Die.</p>
<p>If you have competency in that skill, you can add your Competency Die to the dice pool. There are four skills that all player characters are competent at using: Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and Observation.</p>
<p>You can have +0, +1, +2, +3, +4, or +5 ranks in each specialty, although a starting character is initially limited to only +2 ranks. Each rank adds an additional die of the same size as your Attribute Die to the dice pool; these are your Specialty Dice.</p>
<p>Many specialties allow you to add an Item Die from a tool or item to the dice pool as well, as described under the separate listings for each specialty. Weapon Dice and Armor Dice are subcategories of Item Dice; you can only add a Weapon or Armor die if you have prowess with that weapon or armor. You can have only one Item Die in any given dice pool.</p>
<p>You might have a Bonus Die that you can include in your dice pool under certain circumstances. Tag Dice and Advantage Dice are subcategories of Bonus Dice. A Tag Die is temporary and is based on a word, a phrase, a person, a place, a thing, or a concept. Your Advantage Die is used in combat, and can progress from +1D6 up to +1D12. You can only have one Bonus Die in a dice pool.</p>
<p>Factors that make your skills harder to use assign a Drop Penalty to your dice pool. Such factors range from Wounds to language barriers. Each Drop Penalty specifies a number of dice that are dropped – meaning removed – from your dice pool before you roll. A Drop 2 penalty means you remove 2 dice. You can choose which dice to drop, and so you’re going to want to drop the smallest size dice.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished constructing your dice pool, you roll all the dice at once. You select the dice that resulted in the highest two numbers, and you discard the results of the other dice. Then you see what the MJ rolls on the opposition dice.</p>
<p>There are two types of opposition dice. Some are rolls of your opponent’s corresponding specialty, such as her Defense (Parry) roll against your Dueling (Lunge) roll. In other situations you might be rolling against standard opposition, rolled by the MJ. Standard opposition pools consist of three dice of the same size, from Easy (3D6) to Very Difficult (3D12).</p>

<p>The total of your roll is the sum of the two dice you kept after rolling. The success points generated by your roll equal the lower of the two dice. If you beat the total of the opposition dice, then you can spend those success points on the success table for that specialty. Otherwise, your opponent can spend her success points.</p>
<p>You can usually buy a result from a success table multiple times, unless it says otherwise in the description of the specialty. Success points you don’t use are simply discarded when you finish buying the results you want.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to spend success points is to buy a style point for 3 success points. You use style points to power your style maneuvers, which let you combine together the Specialty Dice of two different specialties, set one die in a pool to its maximum value before you roll, or reroll a result that you don’t like. You can only have 3 style points at a time, so if you already have 3, you can’t buy any more.</p>

</table>
<p>Skills and Specialties are described below, with a Success Table for each Specialty. You gain a set of skills and specialties from each of your classes (or backstory), and additional skills and specialty ranks from customizing your character. As you gain experience points, you can spend XP to increase your ranks in your specialties, or add new skills.</p>
<p>The Success Tables that follow are meant to be a guideline for you and the MJ to determine what happens based on any given roll. They are not meant to override the fictional narrative; a result can only happen if it makes sense in the context of the story.</p>
<p>At the MJ’s discretion, a different table can be used for any Specialty – or a result from any Success Table – for the price of one additional Success Point. This allows for flexibility in player actions by comparing against similar tasks, and using those results.</p>
<h3 id="generic-success-tables">Generic Success Tables</h3>
<p>The following Success Tables can be used in lieu of, or in addition to, the specific Success Tables for each Specialty. The results should be used loosely and with discretion, as some results might not be justified based on the fictional context.</p>
<h4 id="non-combat-skills-in-combat">Non-Combat Skills in Combat</h4>
<p>This table can be used to represent Skills which aren’t normally intended for a fight (i.e., not Defense, Dueling, Aim, or Brawl) but which end up being used anyway. For example, a Mechanician might attempt to overload one of her devices or a Virtuosa could sing loud enough to shatter glass.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> The opposition dice can be anywhere from Easy (3D6) to Very Difficult (3D12) depending on the MJ’s assessment of the situation. Alternately, the target can defend with an appropriate Defense specialty, if the MJ decides the Skill use is similar to an attack.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Inflict 1 Yield:</strong> Your opponent takes one Yield for every two Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce Yield Taken:</strong> If you have taken Yield, you can reduce it by spending three Success Points per point of Yield.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Advantage:</strong> You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don’t already have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Inflict 1 Wound:</strong> Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and is dying.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge-rolls">Knowledge Rolls</h4>
<p>Use this table for general knowledge rolls – for example, if a character with ranks in Science (Clockworks) is trying to recall the name of a famous Mechanician or a Chirurgeon is remembering the facts about a disease. Each Specialty has one or more examples of knowledge rolls that can be made with that Specialty, although the lists are not exhaustive. MJs and players should be creative in how they use Specialties to make knowledge rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Characters automatically succeed on Knowledge checks, and the success points generated indicate how much information they’re able to recall.</p>

<h4 id="standard-opposition-results">Standard Opposition Results</h4>
<p>These results can be used by the MJ when a player’s roll against Standard Opposition dice fails. As with other generic result tables, these should be used with discretion, as not all results will fit the fictional circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Standard Opposition is only rolled in response to an action taken by a player character. If the Standard Opposition roll beats the action’s roll, the MJ may spend the Success Points on this table, as well as declaring the action invalidated.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Increase Difficulty:</strong> Step up one of the dice used in the roll, if the player character (or an ally) attempts the same task. For example, if the Standard Difficulty was Moderate (3D8), with one Success Point you could step up one die, making it 1D10+2D8 on subsequent attempts. If you spend three Success Points, step up all three of the dice.</p>
<p><strong>Inflict 1 Yield:</strong> If the player character is attempting something physically, mentally, or emotionally taxing, you can choose to inflict Yield on her. Each additional two Success Points inflicts an extra point of Yield.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Tension:</strong> You gain a D6 Tension Die if you don’t already have Tension, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12. Describe how the tension in the current situation increases based on the player character’s failure at the task.</p>
<p><strong>Mysterious Omen:</strong> Something ominous happens, perhaps foreshadowing a future event. Players can attempt a Portents roll if they wish to try to interpret the omen.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Gratification:</strong> The player character (or an ally) cannot make another attempt at the same task until a certain amount of time has passed. If the task normally takes one round, she must wait for a minute; if a minute, then for an hour; if an hour, then for four hours; if four hours, then for a day.</p>
<p><strong>Grant 1 Style Point:</strong> Assign a Style Point to one of your non-player characters, usually a Minor or Major Opponent. Minor Opponents can have up to three Style Points, Major Opponents can have up to six Style Points, and other characters can have only one Style Point.</p>
<p><strong>Rude Interruption:</strong> The player character fails to complete her task because someone rudely barges in, interrupting her. Choose one of your existing NPCs or create a new character to intrude on the character; this could even be a hostile opponent, although not a Major Opponent. She won’t be able to resume her task until she manages to send away the intruder.</p>
<p><strong>Unnecessary Distraction:</strong> An event happens nearby that distracts the player character, causing her to fail on her attempt. This could be a loud noise outside, a sudden wind blowing around some papers, a horse that decides to bolt, or an attractive person passing by. If the player character (or an ally) attempts the task again, she gets a Drop 2 penalty on the roll.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge a Passion:</strong> Choose one of the player character’s Passions, and a way in which it becomes challenged. Perhaps the Personification of the Passion appears (as an NPC), or the player character remembers something about that Personification (if not able to appear in person). Maybe the situation changes so that the player character has to choose between her values and succeeding at the task. Be creative! The game result is that if the player character attempts the task again, add her Passion Die to the Standard Opposition dice on subsequent tries.</p>
<p><strong>Incredibly Bad Fortune:</strong> Something goes disastrously wrong. A ship at sea gets lost, a device being created explodes, a gun misfires, the guards show up at the wrong moment, or the player character trips and falls in front of an audience. The exact details are up to you, but they should be serious without being directly deadly and possibly very embarrassing. The player character can attempt the task again one she recovers from the effects of her terrible luck.</p>
<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<p>The Culture skill includes arts, history, religion, language, mythology, music, customs, traditions, noble families, and other societal elements found in the cultures of Elara and Ifran.</p>
<p>The Culture specialties are often used as knowledge rolls.</p>
<h4 id="arts">Arts</h4>
<p><em>Verve Specialty</em></p>
<p>Sculpture, music, painting, poetry, sketching, woodcuts, writing, dance, acting, and other forms of art are used to convey the core values of Elaran society. The Arts specialty includes not just basic knowledge of artwork, but also the ability to create works of art and to perform creative works.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Evaluate a piece of art, spot a forgery, remember the name of a famous artist, identify tools and instruments used in art or music.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Create works of art such as drawings, poetry, paintings, sculptures, plays, songs, opera, novellas, and more, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Die:</strong> If you are performing an existing work of art, such as a musical composition or a play, you can include the work’s Tag Die as a Bonus Die.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Under most situations, an Arts roll will automatically succeed and the success points will determine the quality of the performance. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard Opposition of Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.</p>

<p><strong>Successful Performance:</strong> You give a successful performance of a work, be it already prepared or an improvisational performance. You can create a one-word tag with a +1D0 Tag Die. This Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and can be used with other Specialties as a Bonus Die when appropriate. You can make one additional Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for each success point you spend.</p>

<h4 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Etiquette specialty encompasses general knowledge about the customs, politics, traditions, and manners of the cultures of Elara and Ifran, including the use of proper etiquette while in a noble court.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Etiquette:</strong> When dealing with people from other countries or cultures, you get a Drop 2 penalty on Etiquette rolls. If you do not share a common language, the penalty increases to a Drop 4 penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Identify a member of the royal court, read a heraldic coat of arms, remember the correct form of address for a noble title, recall court gossip about a baroness, cite the local laws and customs.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Under most situations, an Etiquette roll will automatically succeed and the success points will determine the quality of one’s behavior. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard Opposition of Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.</p>

<h4 id="scholarship">Scholarship</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>In Gallinea, a well-rounded education is the mark of a civilized woman or man. The Scholarship specialty represents your breadth of book learning and ability to do research when necessary. As such, it is used very often for knowledge rolls and rarely for anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> For every rank you have in Scholarship, you gain an additional language prowess of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Recall basic historical knowledge, identify a spoken or written language, remember a piece of trivia, name some of the most prestigious universities and their professors, understand and disagree with an obscure theological argument.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Write research reports, translations, or non-fiction books, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Extra Time:</strong> You can spend extra time on your Scholarship to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in Culture (Scholarship), as shown on the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Research:</strong> You gain in-depth knowledge about one specific person, place, thing, group, or event for each Success Point you spend. You can only learn things that someone has written down in a book.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Teach a Lesson:</strong> If you spend at least an hour teaching someone, she can temporarily gain Competency in one Skill or language in which you have Competency. This Competency lasts for 24 hours after your instruction ends. For each additional Success Point you spend, you can teach another student at the same time. A student can only learn one such temporary Competency at any time, from any teacher.</p>
<h3 id="defense">Defense</h3>
<p>The Defense skill is used in combat to avoid taking damage. Whenever you are attacked, you can choose which of the appropriate Defense specialties you will use, although depending on the type of attack, your Defense choices may be limited by the type of attack. For example, you can’t really Parry a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Competency:</strong> Player characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> are automatically Competent with the Defense skill.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> Defense rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.</p>
<h4 id="parry">Parry</h4>
<p><em>Verve Specialty</em></p>
<p>A Parry is an attempt to block an attack with a weapon or a buckler; you need to be wielding something in one of your hands in order to make a Parry.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of a Parry is that if you successfully Parry, you can also execute a Riposte – if you’ve got enough Success Points to do so. You can only execute one Riposte per Parry.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> Parry rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility of Weapon Breakage:</strong> If you use Parry to defend against a Lunge attack and are unsuccessful, one possible result for the attacker is to break your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Evaluate a dueling weapon’s quality, remember the names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone’s fencing style.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Bucklers and extra shields, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> A Parry can be used against an attacker’s Lunge, Feint, or Brawl roll, but not against a Riposte or Aim attack.</p>

<p><strong>Increase Advantage:</strong> You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don’t already have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12.</p>
<p><strong>Disarm:</strong> You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to attack you. (This can’t be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.</p>
<h4 id="block">Block</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>A Block roll is an attempt to prevent injury to yourself by using armor, a shield, nearby furniture, terrain, or even a less vulnerable part of your own body.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> Block rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Evaluate the quality of a suit of armor or a shield, remember the names of famous soldiers, identify the blacksmith’s maker’s mark on armor.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Rigid armor, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> A Block roll can be used to defend against an attacker’s Lunge, Riposte, or Aim roll, but not against a Feint or Brawl attack.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiring Speech:</strong> Your words start to sway those who hear them. You can create a tag based on an emotional state, with a +1D0 Tag Die. This Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and can be used with other Specialties as a Bonus Die when appropriate. You can make one additional Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for each success point you spend.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Tag Die: </strong>One Tag Die created by your inspiring speech improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks you have in Interaction (Inspire), as shown on the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Reduce an Ally’s Yield:</strong> If an ally who can hear you has taken Yield, you can reduce it by spending two Success Points per point of Yield.</p>
<p><strong>Inflict 1 Yield:</strong> One opponent who can hear you takes one Yield for every two Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out.</p>
<p><strong>Instill Emotion:</strong> Choose one of the Tags you have active in this scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends for you. One person who can hear you gains either a Drop Penalty or a Bonus Die on all actions related to that Tag, your choice. For each additional success point you spend, you can affect another person. The Drop Penalty decreases after each time it’s applied, and the Bonus Die decreases in size after each use.</p>

<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Provoke Reaction:</strong> You cause someone who can hear you to react to your words, even if she doesn’t really want to. Choose one of the Tags you have active in this scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends for you. The person you’ve affected will react on her next turn based on that Tag. You don’t get to choose the specific reaction, and it’s instead based on how she would normally react to such feelings. For example, if you use a Tag Die of Anger, her response might be to attack you, to fire a scathing insult at you, to burst into tears, to order someone else to attack you, to leave the area, or to mock your clothing choices.</p>
<h4 id="negotiate">Negotiate</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>Negotiate covers diplomatic attempts to persuade someone, to compromise, or give something up in return for something else. In general, to use Negotiate you must be offering a bargaining chip of some kind, although it need not be a completely fair trade.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> If you and the other parties don’t share a common language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> A Negotiate roll for something simple, like haggling over goods, takes one minute. More complicated business deals or diplomacy take an hour or more.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Evaluate the price of an object, recall details on treaties, remember something the other party might have overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Contracts, treaties, and other legal documents, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Negotiate rolls are always opposed by the other party’s Negotiate rolls. If there isn’t a party in opposition to you, you probably aren’t in a negotiation.</p>

<p><strong>Float a Proposal:</strong> You propose a course of action, and create a +1D0 Tag Die based on that proposal. Until the end of the scene, you can use that Tag Die as a Bonus Die on appropriate rolls, including further Negotiate rolls – or Wealth rolls if you are haggling over a purchase. If you create a new proposal, the old Tag Die ends.</p>
<p><strong>Refine the Offer:</strong> For every two success points you spend, the Tag Die of your existing proposal increases by one die size.</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Offer:</strong> If the other party has a Tag Die, you can decrease her die size by one step, or remove her Tag Die entirely if she has a +1D6 Bonus Die.</p>
<p><strong>Put It In Writing:</strong> You get the other party to agree to sign a written document after you close the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Reach Compromise:</strong> You and the other party come to a compromise that benefits you both equally, more or less, and you close the deal. All Tag Dice created by either party immediately end.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Close the Deal:</strong> You end the negotiation. Whatever you and the other party have agreed upon is how it the terms will remain, and the other party won’t renegotiate terms in this scene. If you are haggling over a purchase, you can use the Tag Die of your proposal as a Bonus Die on your wealth roll; if the other party has a Tag Die, she can add that to the opposition roll.</p>
<p><strong>Gain the Upper Hand:</strong> You end the negotiation. You get what you were hoping to gain without major concessions. The other party loses Tag Dice she may have created during the negotiation.</p>
<h4 id="deceive">Deceive</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>Deceive is the ability to tell a believable lie, avoiding telltale quirks and pitfalls that might reveal your duplicity. Lies which are obviously untrue and unbelievable impose a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4, at the MJ’s discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> If you and the other parties don’t share a common language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Deception rolls are made after each new, major claim is made, so could occur after 30 seconds of rambling, or hours of prolonged storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> This Specialty is not often used to make knowledge rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> An alternate identity or a simple disguise, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Use the Intuition specialty of each person who is listening to the lies.</p>

<p><strong>Think on Your Feet:</strong> You come up with something quickly so that you don’t look like you’re obviously making something up. You can create a +1D0 Tag Die based on your lie that you can use as a Bonus Die on appropriate rolls until the end of the scene. Attempts by others to disprove your lie, through logical deduction or knowledge rolls, are made against Easy (3D6) standard opposition.</p>
<p><strong>Appear Sincere:</strong> You lie while giving the impression that you really do believe what you’re saying. For every two success points you spend, the Tag Die of your lie increases by one die size and the difficulty of disproving the lie increases by one step.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Appear Trustworthy:</strong> Even if your lie is later exposed as false, those who heard it still believe you that you didn’t intend to deceive them. Maybe you were mistaken, or they misheard you, or you misspoke.</p>
<h3 id="magicks">Magicks</h3>
<p>The world of Elara has very subtle forms of magick: brewing draughts, weaving charms into clothing, and reading portents. Most characters completely lack knowledge in Magicks, leaving the study up to those who specialize in it.</p>
<p>Successfully using a Magicks specialty results in the creation of a Charm die. As with other types of dice, you can have only one Charm die in any dice pool.</p>
<h4 id="weave">Weave</h4>
<p><em>Verve Specialty</em></p>
<p>Charmwoven clothing must be specifically created for each character using the Weave specialty, as it involves knowledge of the wearer’s birthstone and other personal qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Evaluate charmwoven items and identify their charms, determine the specific master charmweaver who created an item of apparel, recall facts related to the creation of cloth and silk.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting: </strong>Articles of clothing, including charmwoven apparel, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Most Weave rolls are made to craft garments. Sensing or restoring a charm is Easy (3D6) standard opposition. An attempt to suppress a or bolster a Charm Die is made against standard opposition corresponding to the size of the Charm Die – Easy (3D6) for a +1D6 Charm Die, Moderate (3D8) for a +1D8 Charm Die, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Sense Charm: </strong>You can sense charms woven into clothing that are in the same area as you, starting with the nearest charm to you. You learn the article of clothing that’s encharmed and which Specialty the Charm Die applies to. If you spend another success point, you also learn the size of the Charm Die. For each additional success point you spend, you can sense another charm in your area or an adjacent area. You can choose to skip over any charm created or worn by you.</p>
<p><strong>Suppress Charm Die: </strong>You can choose one article of clothing in the same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is reduced by one step. If it has a +1D6 Charm Die, you can remove it entirely. This effect lasts until the end of the current scene. Each additional 2 success points you spend reduces the Charm Die by one step. You can reduce a Charm Die as many steps as you have ranks in Magicks (Weave).</p>
<p><strong>Bolster Charm Die:</strong> You can choose one article of clothing in the same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is increased by one step until the end of the scene. You can only increase a Charm Die by one step.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Restore Charm Die: </strong>You can choose one article of clothing in the same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die that has been suppressed or temporarily removed, you can restore the Charm Die to its normal value. Until the end of the scene, that article’s Charm Die can’t be suppressed.</p>
<h4 id="brew">Brew</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>Brew is the magickal ability to distill enchantments into drinkable draughts.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Identify a draught and its effects, recall the names of the master alchemists in a city, describe where exotic ingredients can be found.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting: </strong>Salves, draughts, and other alchemical formulations, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Most Magicks (Brew) rolls are made to create a draught or salve. Mixing a concoction has a standard difficulty of Easy (3D6).</p>

<p><strong>Mix a Concoction:</strong> You hastily mix together volatile chemicals and reagents to produce an immediate reaction. You spend 1 unit of alchemical ingredients and create one of the concoctions listed in Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment”. The concoction has an initial potency level of 1 but increases by 1 for every 2 success points you spend. The concoction lasts until your next turn, after which it becomes inert.</p>
<p><strong>Apply a Concoction:</strong> You apply the effects of your concoction to yourself, your area, an adjacent area, or another person in the same area as you. Each recipient of the effect beyond the first requires that you spend 1 additional unit of alchemical ingredients, with a limit of additional targets equal to your specialty ranks in Magicks (Brew).</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<h4 id="portents">Portents</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Portents specialty involves reading omens and signs as well as using cards, dice, tea leaves, or astrological charts to determine someone’s future. It also includes placing hexes on people, and creating simple trinkets known as bibelots that ward off hexes and bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Recall the names of famous seers or witches throughout history, identify when someone is the target of a hex, identify a bibelot’s charm, remember the astrological signs and birthstones.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting: </strong>Astrological charts, bibelots, and divination tools, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> If you read either the general omens around you or a willing subject, the roll is an automatic success and the success points determine the strength of the reading. If you are doing a reading on an unwilling subject or if you are casting a hex on someone, the difficulty is either Easy (3D6) or an opposed Magicks (Portents) roll, whichever is better for the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Read Portents:</strong> You make a general prediction about the next 24 hours. Ask one yes-or-no question, or have the person you’re reading ask a yes-or-no question. You receive an answer which creates a +1D0 Tag Die connected to that answer. Until the prediction comes true or 24 hours passes, the subject of the reading can choose to use the tag as a Bonus Die on any rolls that relate to the answer proving true. Each use of the Tag Die decreases its size by one die size, or ends the prediction if it’s a +1D0 Bonus Die. As long as any prediction is still in effect, the subject can’t be the recipient of another reading.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Accuracy:</strong> The Tag Die increases by one die size, with a limit set by your ranks in Magicks (Portents) as shown in the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Increase Specificity:</strong> The subject of the reading can ask another yes-or-no question and receive an answer, or ask a question that can be answered with a single noun. This creates an additional +1D0 Tag Die based on the new question, that otherwise functions like the first Tag Die. The maximum number of additional questions is limited to the number of Magicks (Portents) specialty ranks you have.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Cast a Hex:</strong> You choose one skill and the subject of your reading becomes cursed on rolls with that skill for the next 24 hours. If your subject is wearing a bibelot for that skill, the hex immediately ends and the bibelot is destroyed. Otherwise, any existing hexes on her end and she gains a Drop 1 penalty on that skill and its specialties. Every time the Drop penalty is applied to one of her rolls, it decreases by 1. When the Drop penalty is reduced to 0, the hex ends. For every two success points you spend, you can increase the initial size of the Drop penalty by 1, with a limit determined by your ranks in Portents as shown on the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Patient Survives:</strong> Despite the relatively advanced state of Elaran medicine, surgery remains a risky proposition. If you don’t spend one Success Point to ensure the life of the patient, the patient takes one Wound.</p>
<p><strong>Heal 1 Wound:</strong> The patient heals one Wound. This requires that you spend 1 unit of medicine per wound healed.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Surgical Procedure:</strong> You perform a minor surgical procedure, such as suturing a wound or the setting of a bone. The patient must rest for 1 day or else gain one Wound the first time she engages in physical activity. A minor procedure expends 2 units of medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Major Surgical Procedure:</strong> You perform a major surgical procedure, such as a Caesarian section, gender confirmation surgery, or removal of the appendix. The patient must rest for 1 week (six days) or else gain one Wound the first time each day that she engages in physical activity. A major procedure expends 5 units of medicine.</p>
<h4 id="treat">Treat</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Treat specialty is used to care for those who are injured or sick. After a Wound is taken, only one Treat roll can be made; further Wounds must be healed using the Surgery specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Diagnose a patient as suffering from poison or disease, determine the cause of an injury, recall facts about a known illness and useful folk cures for the same.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Cures for diseases and other medical supplies, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Base Time:</strong> Treating a wound or removing Yield takes one minute, and treating diseases or applying cures takes one hour.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Time:</strong> You can spend extra time on treatment to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> The opposition depends on the severity of the condition being treated. Reducing Yield is an automatic success, with the number of success points determining how many points of Yield are removed. Treating wounds is Easy (3D6), and treating a disease is dependent upon the severity of the disease.</p>
<h6 id="treat-1">Treat</h6>
<div class="line-block">Time: | 1 minute or 1 hour |<br />
Opposition: | Standard Opposition |<br />

<p><strong>Reduce Patient’s Yield:</strong> If someone in the same area as you has taken Yield, you can remove one point of Yield per success point you spend. This expends one unit of medicine, regardless of how many success points you spend.</p>
<p><strong>Heal 1 Wound:</strong> The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed, and requires one minute of time.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Heal 1 Wound:</strong> The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed, and requires one minute of time.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce Disease Severity:</strong> The severity of the disease decreases by one step, or is eliminated if the disease is already of the weakest severity. This consumes one unit of medicine for each severity level decreased.</p>
<h4 id="poison">Poison</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Poison specialty covers the creation, application, and use of various toxic substances as well as antidotes for the same. A target can be poisoned directly, or poison can be applied to a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Poisons:</strong> The following types poisons are commonly used throughout Elara and Ifran: deadly poison, impairing poison, and sleep poison. See the Equipment chapter for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Identify a poison without being exposed to it, diagnose someone suffering from poison based on the effects, determine whether or not an item of food is safe to consume.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Poisons and antidotes as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Applying poison to your own weapon is an automatic success, with the number of success points determining how many times you can use that application of poison. Directly administering poison to your victim is opposed by her Brawl roll. Adding poison to food or drink is opposed by the highest Observation of whoever might be able to spot you doing the deed. Administering an antidote is based on the potency of the poison.</p>

<p><strong>Poisoned Weapon:</strong> You can add expend one dose of poison and apply it to a Knife, Sword, Polearm, or the arrows for a Bow. For each success point you spend, you can use the poison’s success table on one attack, in addition to the normal success table for your weapon and attack. Your weapon ceases to be poisoned when you make a number of attacks equal to the success points you spent, when you apply a different poison to the weapon, or at the end of the current scene.</p>
<p><strong>Poison Your Victim:</strong> You can use your Success Points to directly injure or debilitate the target by expending one dose of poison. Each additional success point you spend can be used on the poison’s success table against your victim.</p>
<p><strong>Administer Antidote:</strong> You administer an antidote to someone who has been poisoned, expending one dose of antidote. For every two success points you spend, you can reduce the potency of the poison, reduce the duration of the poison, remove 2 Yield inflicted by the poison, or heal 1 Wound inflicted by poison during the current scene.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Notice:</strong> You apply your poison surreptitiously, hoping to go unseen. The opposition for an Observation roll to spot the poison – either on your blade, in a drink, or in food – is Easy (3D6). For every two additional success points, you can increase the difficulty to spot the posion by one step, limited by your specialty ranks in Medicine (Poison) as shown in the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Inflict 1 Yield:</strong> Your opponent takes one Yield for each Success Point you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out.</p>
<p><strong>Negate Brawl Attack:</strong> You prevent a Brawl attack from doing any damage to you, and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you don’t do this, the attack still takes effect on you, with the attacker spending her Success Points normally.</p>
<p><strong>Achieve or Break Hold:</strong> You achieve a hold on your target, or if you are already held, you can break that hold. You can choose to do both in one roll, if you have enough Success Points. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Knockdown:</strong> Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result in her falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. A prone character suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and cannot Move or Run until she stands up; standing up is a Drop 1 combined action.</p>
<p><strong>Disarm:</strong> You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is wielding. You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.</p>

<p><strong>Handle Animal:</strong> You can make a domesticated animal perform one of its tricks, go where you want it to go, or otherwise follow your directions. With a wild animal, you can either make it flee or convince it to not attack you and your companions until the end of the scene as long as you don’t approach it. If you’re riding a horse, each Success Point you spend allows you to clear one obstacle such as a fence, hedge, or stream.</p>
<p>When you successfully use Handle Animal, you create a +1D0 one-word Tag Die for the animal’s attitude toward you that can be used as a Bonus Die in Nature or Defense checks against that animal. The Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and increases by one step for every 2 success points you spend, up to a maximum based on your ranks in Husbandry as shown in the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Gather Crops:</strong> Assuming you have access to a field of crops, you can harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each additional success point you spend, you can harvest an additional 2 units of foodstuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy Farming:</strong> Assuming you have access to milk cows, chickens, and other farm animals, you can harvest 2 units of foodstuffs. For each additional success point you spend, you can harvest an additional 2 units of foodstuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Veterinary Medicine:</strong> You can heal one Wound that has been inflicted on an animal in the current scene, or you can decrease the severity of a disease affecting an animal. Each Wound treated or disease severity reduced requires that you spend one dose of medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Butchery:</strong> You slaughter and butcher an animal to create foodstuffs. An animal can provide a number of foodstuffs equal to its yield limit. Farm animals provide an additional 50% more foodstuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Teach a New Trick:</strong> You can teach a new trick to a domesticated animal. If the animal already knows as many tricks as you have Specialty ranks of Husbandry, or is an old dog, you can’t teach it any new tricks. For a wild animal, domesticating it counts as one of its tricks.</p>
<h4 id="prowl">Prowl</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Prowl specialty represents stealthy, secretive movement or action, usually taken outdoors where there is sufficient cover or shadows to hide from observers.</p>
<p>You make a Prowl roll as an action when you are not hidden and attempt to do so, or as a free roll if you are already out of sight and someone is looking for you. If you move from your location without moving undetected, you must make another Prowl roll.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> Prowl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Remember old abandoned bandit hideouts, recall the names of famous brigands.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Hiding under optimal conditions (night, no moon, inclement weather) is normally an automatic success. Such situations are rare, however. Instead, most Prowl rolls are Easy (3D6) under ordinary circumstances. Increase the standard difficulty by one step for each of the following conditions: tracked by animals, bright sunlight, lack of cover, quiet location.</p>

<p><strong>Lead the Ambush:</strong> You can extend the effects of your Prowl roll to one additional ally in the same Area as you for each Success Point you spend on Lead the Ambush. This can include hiding, increasing advantage, or moving undetected.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Advantage:</strong> You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don’t already have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of D12.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>

<h3 id="observation">Observation</h3>
<p>The Observation skill encompasses both reading situations and reading people, as well as putting together disparate clues to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Competency:</strong> Player characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> are automatically Competent with the Observation skill.</p>
<h4 id="perceive">Perceive</h4>
<p><em>Verve Specialty</em></p>
<p>With a Perceive roll, you can spot a person in a crowd, listen for one voice in a chorus, notice the smell of burning wood, or detect an ambush before it happens. The MJ can call for Perceive as a free roll, or you can make additional rolls by using your action to examine your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Accurately describe someone you have seen or heard, or identify her from a description.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition: </strong>Under most circumstances, a Perceive roll is an automatic success and the number of success points determines how well you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for spotting someone or something hidden is determined by the hider’s Nature (Prowl) or Streetwise (Larceny) roll. Trying to Perceive something under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.</p>

<p><strong>Notice the Obvious:</strong> You notice something which is pretty easy to spot but not directly in front of you, or you spot someone who is hiding from you. For each additional success point, you spot something else that isn’t directly in front of you or hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Notice Minor Detail:</strong> You notice a small detail about a person, an animal, an object, a vehicle, or an area that most people wouldn’t catch. For every 2 additional success points, you notice another detail about the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Notice Hidden Detail:</strong> You make note of a tiny detail that someone has taken pains to hide, disguise, or eliminate.</p>
<h4 id="intuition">Intuition</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>Intuition involves reading subtle cues from your environment, including non-verbal cues from other people. The MJ can call for Intuition as a free roll, or you can make additional rolls by using your action to examine your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Remember something that you didn’t consciously notice at the time you saw it, recall someone that you met in your childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition: </strong>Under most circumstances, an Intuition roll is an automatic success and the number of success points determines how well you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for sensing someone or something hidden is determined by the hider’s Nature (Prowl) or Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to intuit something under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.</p>

<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Sense Falsehood:</strong> You can tell when someone is lying to you, picking up on her unconscious tells. You don’t know what the truth is, but you do know you’re not hearing it now. For the rest of the scene, you know when she’s telling you the truth and when she’s not.</p>
<h4 id="deduce">Deduce</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Deduce specialty lets you size up a situation and formulate a scenario in which they make sense, as provided by the MJ. This will always be a supplement to your own roleplaying and decision-making processes while playing <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>; it is not meant to substitute for player ingenuity. Deduce can also be used to analyze clues and spot falsehoods.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Remember the solution to a puzzle you’ve solved before, decipher a coded message, recall the names of famous detectives.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition: </strong>Under most circumstances, a Deduce roll is an automatic success and the number of success points determines how well you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for detecting someone or something hidden is determined by the hider’s Nature (Prowl) or Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll.

<p><strong>Reach Simple Conclusion:</strong> You draw a basic conclusion from the available facts. You need to have recognized at least one clue to reach a conclusion. The conclusion will be simple and straightforward, a la Ockham’s razor, but is not guaranteed to be correct. Each time you find another clue, you automatically know whether it fits your simple conclusion or not.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Infer Greater Plan:</strong> You can determine whether or not something was deliberately done, and if so, become aware that there is more to the situation than what appears. If you witness more of this plan in action, you will automatically know that it’s part of the same scheme, even if you don’t yet know the role it plays.</p>
<p><strong>Reach Complex Conclusion:</strong> You draw together several clues to form a more complex scenario that fits the facts as you understand them. The complex conclusion is guaranteed to be more accurate than a simple conclusion, but it may not include all the variables and thus may be subject to misunderstanding or inaccuracies. Each time you find another clue or witness more of a plan, you automatically know how to include it in your complex conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>Science is a skill that covers the use, repair, and creation of advanced technology and complex mathematics, from time watches to airships, from repeating cannons to wing-gliders. The Blackpowder specialty also covers the use of explosives.</p>
<h4 id="blackpowder">Blackpowder</h4>
<p><em>Verve Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Blackpowder specialty is used to work with explosives of all types, as well as the rare phlogistone material that allows airships to soar through the sky. Skilled powderworkers are employed by militaries, by craftsmen, and by airship crews.</p>
<p>A Blackpowder roll is used to fire cannons and throw grenades, which cause explosive damage to all within a given Area or to structures such as buildings or ships. Although pistols and muskets use blackpowder to fire their ammunition, the Military (Aim) skill is used for those hand-held weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Explosion Damage:</strong> An explosion weapon does damage to everything inside a given Area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent Areas, and even targets up to two Areas away for the most powerful explosions.</p>
<p>The person who initiated the explosion makes a Blackpowder roll as an automatic success to set the base damage and the range.</p>
<p>Anyone in an area affected by the explosion makes a Block or Dodge roll that also is an automatic success. For one success point on the Block or Dodge roll, a target gains one less point of Yield, and for three successes she takes one less Wound.</p>

<p><strong>Hit An Area:</strong> You fire an explosive weapon into an area adjacent to your own. For each additional success point you spend, you can move the center of the explosion another area away from you, out to the maximum range of the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Base Damage +1 Wound:</strong> For every two success points you spend, increase the base damage by 1 Wound. This increase to the Wound damage is limited to twice the number of ranks you have in Science (Blackpowder).</p>
<p><strong>Set Timed Fuse:</strong> You set a timed fuse in your area to detonate within a given period of time. The default fuse for a standard bomb is one to 10 rounds, with the exact number of rounds being up to you. The bomb detonates at the end of the chosen round, after everyone else has acted.</p>
<p><strong>Detonate Charges:</strong> You immediately detonate a bomb in your own area or an adjacent area. Alternately, you can use a Pistol or Musket within its normal range or a thrown flame within Short range (1 to 2 Areas) to perform this action. Add the Pistol or Musket’s Weapon Die as an Item Die, and apply any Drop Penalties due to the weapon’s normal range.</p>
<p><strong>Expand Radius: </strong>When setting explosives or firing artillery, you can extend the radius of the blast by one step. “Close” becomes “Adjacent”, “Adjacent” becomes “Short”, and so on, out to the maximum radius of the explosives.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Disarm Explosives:</strong> You disarm a bomb or other explosive device that has not yet detonated.</p>
<h4 id="clockworks">Clockworks</h4>
<p><em>Affinity Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Clockworks specialty allows you to create, repair, and customize clockwork devices. For more details, see the list of clockwork devices and components in Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment.”</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Identify the functions and components of a clockwork device, recall the names of famous mechanicians, determine what components of a device are malfunctioning, read and understand plans drawn by other clockworkers.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting: </strong>Clockwork devices, components, power sources, and other mechanical contrivances, as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Time: </strong>It takes one action to keep a device together or draw more power from it. Sabotaging a device takes 1 minute. To repair a device or salvage components from it takes 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Die:</strong> If you have plans for the device you’re working on, you can add the bonus die from those plans to the roll, in addition to any applicable Item Die.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Time:</strong> You can spend extra time repairing, salving, or sabotaging a device to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks), as shown on the following tables:</p>

<p><strong>Rushing: </strong>You can reduce the time to repair, salvage, or sabotage a device by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can’t rush a job that you’re taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush the task, as shown on the following table:</p>

<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> The standard opposition for working with a clockwork device is normally Easy (3D6). If you created or assembled the device yourself, the roll is an automatic success and the success points are used to determine how well you accomplished the task. For each component in a device that is beyond your ability to create, based on your Science (Clockworks) skill, increase the standard opposition by one step.</p>
<h6 id="clockworks-1">Clockworks</h6>
<div class="line-block">Time: | 1 action, 1 minute, or 1 hour |<br />

++: | Repair 1 Malfunction |<br />
++: | Salvage a Component |<br />
+++: | Gain 1 Style Point |<br />
++++: | Sabotage Device |</div>
<p><strong>Keep It Together:</strong> You manage to patch the device together long enough that one malfunction doesn’t affect it until the end of the next round. For each additional success point, you increase the duration by another round.</p>
<p><strong>We Need More Power: </strong>You manage to coax an extra point of power out of a device’s power source for every two success points you spend, with a limit of extra power equal to your ranks in Science (Clockworks). The increased power lasts until you spend it or the end of the next round. At the end of the scene, the device gains one malfunction for every time you boosted the power output.</p>
<p><strong>Repair 1 Malfunction:</strong> You fix the device and remove a malfunction in one of its components. Each malfunction removed requires the expenditure of one unit of supplies of a type used to create the component.</p>
<p><strong>Salvage a Component:</strong> You can remove one functioning component or power source from the device, for use in later devices; this requires at least an hour’s worth of work. You can’t salvage a malfunctioning or destroyed component. Alternately, you can destroy a component or power source to regain one unit of supplies of a type used to create the component.</p>
<p><strong>Gain 1 Style Point:</strong> You gain one Style Point; you must describe how you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of three Style Points at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Sabotage Machine:</strong> You add a malfunction to one component in a device. If you spend an extra success point, you can remove the malfunction later by taking a single action to do so.</p>
<h4 id="calculus">Calculus</h4>
<p><em>Guile Specialty</em></p>
<p>The Calculus specialty includes all manner of calculations of numbers, from adding sums to deriving mathematical equations. Experienced merchants and moneylenders also use Calculus regularly in order to balance their books, and mariners use Calculus to create their charts.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Rolls:</strong> Read and understand the meaning behind complex equations, recall the names of famous mathematicians and scientists.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Calculations, clockwork plans, and mathematical theorems as described in Chapter 10, “Crafting.”</p>
<p><strong>Opposition:</strong> Use Easy (3D6) for calculations done in a well-equipped workshop, or Moderate (3D8) for field work with paper and ink. Doing calculations in your head is Hard (3D10).</p>

<p><strong>Simple Calculation:</strong> You perform a simple calculation such as determining the size or speed of an object.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics:</strong> You create a +1D0 Tag Die based one specialty that can be used as a Bonus Die until the end of the scene. The Tag Die can only be used in a roll that uses quantities, measurements, prices, or other numbers. Examples include navigating with Nature (Explore), cooking food with Nature (Husbandry), haggling over a price with Interaction (Negotiate), or aiming a cannon with Science (Blackpowder). For every two additional success points you spend, you can increase the Tag Die by one size, with a limit based on your ranks in Science (Calculus) as shown in the following table:</p>

<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p>As described in Chapter 4, “Skills &amp; Specialties,” characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> can use most specialties in order to craft items related to that specialty. The requirements for crafting are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to spend time.</strong> The time varies – minutes, hours, days, weeks. You can’t craft more than 8 hours in a day. (Lutetia’s unions are quite strong.) You may be able to increase or decrease the time to craft an item, to affect your success at crafting.</li>
<li><strong>You need tools to work.</strong> If you don’t have the right tools, you at least need something that can function as the right tools, even if you don’t get an Item Die from the makeshift tool.</li>
<li><strong>You need at least one specialty rank.</strong> You can’t make a crafting roll based on the skill alone. Each further specialty rank adds new items you can craft.</li>
<li><strong>You need to expend supplies.</strong> Supplies are counted in “units”, an abstracted measure of the raw material you have on hand. In most cases, you can’t substitute something else, but check with your MJ.</li>
<li><strong>You need to make a specialty roll.</strong> If you’ve met all the other requirements listed above, you automatically succeed on the roll and craft something. The purpose of the roll is to determine how well of a job you did on the crafting. The more success points you spend, the better the final product. You can’t gain style points on crafting rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="extra-supplies-2">Extra Supplies</h5>
<p>Sometimes you can spend more supplies than you need in order to craft a superior item. You could create a larger or more ornate version of an item, or perhaps simply make several prototypes before eventually getting it right.</p>
<p>If the crafting Specialty has an “Extra Supplies” entry, you can use more materials than needed while crafting to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in the Specialty, as shown on the following tables:</p>

<h5 id="repairs">Repairs</h5>
<p>If you can create something, you can repair it as well. A damaged object gains Malfunctions in the same way that a person gains Wounds. In terms of game rolls, the object has a certain Drop penalty applied whenever it’s used – Drop 1 for each Malfunction – or one of its functions simply stops operating.</p>
<p>The time to repair an object depends on the time it would take to create a new one of the same type, as shown on the following table.</p>

</table>
<p>You can take extra time or rush the repair if you are able to do the same when creating the item.</p>
<p>As with normal crafting rolls, you automatically succeed. Each success point gained reduces the Drop penalty by one, or restores one function to working order. For every complete set of three Malfunctions you repair, you have to spend 1 unit of any type of supplies that would be used to create such an item.</p>
<h5 id="rushing">Rushing</h5>
<p>You don’t always have the luxury of time when crafting. Perhaps there’s only 30 minutes until the brigands arrive and you still need to build that net-flinging mechanical trap you’ve been planning out in your head. In such a situation, you can rush your work to get it done in time.</p>
<p>If the crafting Specialty has a “Rushing” entry, you can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can’t rush a job that you’re taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting, as shown on the following table:</p>
<p>Rushing also increases the opposition from an automatic success to Easy (3D6). If you fail on a rushed crafting roll, you expend one unit of resources as appropriate for your task</p>

<h5 id="success-limits">Success Limits</h5>
<p>You must have at least one rank in a Specialty to be able to craft with that Specialty. However, a single specialty rank limits the quality of the item to a basic work. The more specialty ranks you have, the higher potential you can create.</p>
<p>Each Specialty’s crafting description details the success limits for crafted items. The maximum values for Item Dice, Charm Dice, Bonus Dice, and the Standard Opposition (for attempts to escape or undo your creation) are shown in the following table.

<p><strong>Alchemical ingredients:</strong> Chemicals, herbs, rare salts, parts of animals, and other materials used to create salves, draughts, poison, and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Art media:</strong> Supplies for creating works of art, ranging from canvas and paints to sculpturing clay and marble blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Blackpowder charges:</strong> Units of blackpowder that can create explosive weapons or be purified to produce phlogistone.</p>
<p><strong>Clockwork gears:</strong> The parts needed to create clockwork components that are then assembled into clockwork devices.</p>
<p><strong>Crucible steel:</strong> Worked metal that can used to make weapons, armor, clockwork gears, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Fabric:</strong> Cloth, lace, thread, silk, dyes, leather, buttons, and other materials for making clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Foodstuffs:</strong> Grains, fruit, meat, cheeses, sugar, eggs, bread, and other materials for cooking. One unit of uncrafted foodstuffs is enough to feed one person for one day.</p>
<p><strong>Medicine:</strong> Medicine, medicinal herbs, and other medical supplies used to treat injuries, cure diseases, create antidotes, and perform surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Writing materials:</strong> Paper and ink, used in creating reports, plans, and written works of art.</p>
<h6 id="scrounging">Scrounging</h6>
<p>If you have neither the necessary supplies on hand nor the ability to purchase more, you can spend your time scrounging – looking in refuse bins for art supplies, junk piles for crucible steel, discarded trimmings for fabric, or roadkill and old fruit for foodstuffs. Every two hours spent scrounging produces one unit of supplies – as long as your MJ agrees there are such supplies to be found. If you’re lost in the middle of a frozen tundra, you probably can’t find blackpowder charges just waiting for you to come along.</p>
<h5 id="tag-dice">Tag Dice</h5>
<p>As described in Chapter 4, “Skills &amp; Specialties”, Tag Dice are a type of Bonus Dice that are tied to a specific concept. This could be a single word, an emotion, a Passion, a phrase, or other abstract constructions. The crafting description for each Specialty describes how each Tag is created, what you can associate each Tag with, and how you can increase the Bonus Die size of the Tag.</p>
<p>For example, if you create a painting of Scanbreille Keep as seen from a grassy meadow, you could assign a Tag of “Peaceful.” The Tag Die starts at +1D0, and for every 2 success points, you can increase the size of that die. You can also use success points to add a different Tag, such as “Loyalty.” These additional dice also start at +1D0.</p>
<p>The Tag Die can be added to a dice pool as a Bonus Die whenever it makes sense in the story – so if you’re trying to calm down a visiting dignitary, you might seat her under the painting and add the Peaceful tag to your Interaction (Negotiate) dice pool. Alternately, if you’re trying to inspire the soldiers of Scanbreille Keep to stand firm and not desert in the face of the enemy, you may want to make your Interaction (Inspire) roll when you stand in front of the painting of the iconic castle.</p>
<h5 id="weapon-qualities">Weapon Qualities</h5>
<p>When you craft a weapon, it’s assumed to be a “stock” version of that weapon as described in Chapter 8, “Equipment.” If you want to add something extra to a crafted weapon, you can add a Weapon Quality to that weapon. Each specialty’s crafting description lists which qualities can be given to each type of weapon. The maximum number of Weapon Qualities you can add to any given weapon equals your rank in the crafting Specialty.</p>
<p>Rather than repeating the descriptions of Weapon Qualities in each crafting specialty, they’re listed here for easy reference. You can’t add the same Weapon Quality twice to a single weapon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cavalry:</strong> A weapon with the Cavalry quality must be used with your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding a mount, you can substitute the mount’s Item Die for your Weapon Die against an unmounted opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Defending:</strong> You can use this weapon to make a Defense (Parry) roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type of weapon usually can’t be used for parrying.</li>
<li><strong>Double-Barreled:</strong> You can fire twice, once per barrel, without reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases by one step, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it’s harder to aim. Reloading each barrel separately gives the normal Drop penalty for the unaltered weapon, and reloading both barrels is a Drop 4 combined action.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Long Range:</strong> The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at Long range. This can only be applied to weapons which can’t normally be used at Long range, but which can be used at Medium range.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Medium Range:</strong> The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at Medium range. This can only be applied to weapons which can’t normally be used at Medium range.</li>
<li><strong>High-Caliber:</strong> Increase the Weapon Die by one step. The Drop penalty for reloading the weapon increases by 1, and the Drop penalty at Long range increases by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Lightened:</strong> Decrease the Weapon Die by one step. If the unaltered weapon could be used in your main hand, you can now use it in either. If the weapon required two hands to use, it can now be used with just the main hand. You can’t lighten a weapon that’s been weighted.</li>
<li><strong>Point Blank:</strong> Decrease the Drop Penalty for Close range by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Quickloading:</strong> Decrease the Drop Penalty for reloading this weapon by 1.</li>
<li><strong>Reach:</strong> The weapon can be used to attack into an adjacent area as well as your own.</li>
<li><strong>Responding:</strong> The weapon can be used to make a Dueling (Riposte) roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type of weapon usually can’t be used for riposting.</li>
<li><strong>Rifled:</strong> Reduce the Drop Penalty at Medium range by 1 and at Long range by 1.</li>
<li><strong>Sparring:</strong> You can use this weapon to make a Military (Brawl) roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though weapons usually can’t be used with Brawl.</li>
<li><strong>Success Table: Specialty (Option)</strong> You add an option for spending success points to a specific Success Table. The details for each option are described later in this section.</li>
<li><strong>Throwable:</strong> You can throw this weapon at a target using the Military (Aim) skill and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type of weapon usually can’t be thrown. The weapon has no Drop penalty at Close range, Drop 1 at Short range, and Drop 3 at Medium range.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted:</strong> Increase the Weapon Die by one step. If the weapon could be used in either hand, it now is only usable in your main hand. If the unaltered weapon required your main hand, it now requires both hands. You can’t weight a weapon that’s been lightened.</li>

<p><strong>Basket Hilt:</strong> If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease her die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she has +1D6 Advantage. Weapons with this quality are designed for parrying.</p>
<p><strong>Disarming:</strong> You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to attack you or the weapon she’s using to Parry your attack. (This can’t be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free. Weapons with this quality are designed for disarming opponents.</p>
<p><strong>Entangling:</strong> You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon, holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4. Your opponent can escape by making a simple check against Standard Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon attack.</p>
<p><strong>Retort:</strong> You can make a Riposte attack. Weapons with this quality are designed for parrying and allow a Riposte to be made for a lower cost than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Tripping:</strong> Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. Weapons with this quality are designed to pull an opponent off her feet.</p>
<p><strong>Unhorse:</strong> If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that mount and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your mount can make a trample attack right now for free, if it has that quality. Standing up is a Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3 penalty. Weapons with this quality are designed for dismounting opponents.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon-Breaking:</strong> You snap your target’s blade or hilt. You can only do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or if you are performing a Parry yourself. Weapons with this quality are designed for catching and destroying weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Wounding:</strong> Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a lower cost than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Yielding:</strong> Your opponent takes four Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Yield for a lower cost than usual.</p>
<h5 id="workrooms">Workrooms</h5>
<p>Basic sets of handheld tools are described in Chapter 8, “Equipment,” and can be used as an Item Die on appropriate crafting rolls.</p>
<p>However, most serious crafting work is done in some kind of dedicated room or outbuilding. Such workrooms have everything you’d find in a set of tools, plus additional equipment, furniture, and resources for each task. These workrooms can provide an Item Die, as shown on the following table. As you can only have one Item Die per dice pool, you can’t combine the Item Die from a set of tools with the Item Die from a workroom.</p>

<p>Superior workrooms can be purchased for twice the listed cost and an Item Die of one step higher. A superior kitchen costs 4D8 and gives a +1D10 Item Die on rolls for cooking. Superior workrooms take 20 hours to set up and can only be acquired in large cities.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at the mundane clothes, weapons, tools, and other items that a cavalier might use during the course of her day.</p>
<h4 id="item-scale">Item Scale</h4>
<p>Every item has a scale that describes the general size of the item: pocket scale, handheld scale, portable scale, human scale, furniture scale, room scale, and building scale. In general, it’s easy enough to determine the scale of most items, but for some items a scale is explicitly listed in the lists that follow.</p>
<p>The scale concept is used in the optional rules for Encumbrance, later in this chapter, as well as for clockwork devices in Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment,” and animals in Chapter 20, “Opponents.”</p>
<h5 id="pocket-scale">Pocket Scale</h5>
<p>A pocket-scale device is light, easily concealed, requires only one hand to operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing without attracting undue notice. Examples include small pistols or knives, flasks of alchemical brews, and a pet mouse.</p>
<p>Weapons of this size are classified as Either Hand weapons.</p>
<h5 id="handheld-scale">Handheld Scale</h5>
<p>A handheld item usually requires one hand to operate and can be carried on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Most can’t be easily concealed unless you’re willing to forego easy access. Examples include most swords, tool kits, bucklers, and large hats.</p>
<p>When describing animals, such as cats or small dogs, handheld scale is known as pet scale. Weapons of this size are classified as Main Hand weapons.</p>
<h5 id="portable-scale">Portable Scale</h5>
<p>A portable-scale item is one which requires two hands to carry and operate, or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Examples include two-handed swords, muskets, and bar stools.</p>
<p>The equivalent scale for animals is companion scale. A portable-scale weapon is classified a Both Hands weapon.</p>
<h5 id="human-scale">Human Scale</h5>
<p>An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue or a suit of rigid armor – can’t be easily carried by a single person without requiring her full attention. Other examples include work carts, heavy chairs, and velocipedes.</p>
<h5 id="furniture-scale">Furniture Scale</h5>
<p>Larger than a human but smaller than a room, a carriage-scale item is around the size of a bed, a wardrobe dresser, or a small carriage. At best, an adult human can drag a furniture-scale item around but can’t pick it up. Other furniture-scale items are horses, rowboats, and thrones.</p>
<p>In descriptions of animals, furniture scale is known as mount scale.</p>
<h5 id="room-scale">Room Scale</h5>
<p>Room-scale items can be rooms themselves, the amount of furnishings it takes to fill up a room, or an object of comparable size. In combat, each room-scale item is usually its own Area.</p>
<p>Mammoth scale is the equivalent of room scale when describing animals.</p>
<h5 id="building-scale">Building Scale</h5>
<p>Building-scale items include buildings, of course, but also large vehicles such as sailing ships or airships. In combat situations, a building-scale object is usually divided into multiple Areas.</p>
<p>When talking about animals this large, such as giant squids or great whales, the term behemoth scale is used.</p>
<h4 id="optional-rule-encumbrance">Optional Rule: Encumbrance</h4>
<p>This is an optional rule that the MJ can use if it will enhance her game. In most cases, the calculations are more effort than they’re worth and rarely provide any actual change in the game. However, if the players start carrying around dozens of heavy items, the MJ might decide that this use can help bring her players’ gear into line with her expectations for the game. <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> is a swashbuckling action game, and not about lugging around heavy weights!</p>
<h5 id="carrying-limit">Carrying Limit</h5>
<p>A human carrying a Person-sized object takes a Drop 2 penalty on attack rolls (Dueling, Brawl, and Aim), and cannot move more than one area in a given turn. Humans cannot usually move items of Carriage size or higher, unless it’s got wheels or something similar.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You pick up an unconscious colleague and carry her over your shoulders. That’s obviously a Person-sized object, so you get a Drop 2 penalty and can’t run.</p>
<h5 id="combining-encumbrance">Combining Encumbrance</h5>
<p>Three items of a smaller size are equivalent to one item of larger size. So three Portable items are as bulky and heavy as one Person-sized object – meaning if you’re carrying a musket, a zweihander, and a pike (all Portable-sized objects), you’ve got the equivalent of a Person-sized object and take the Drop 2 penalty, plus you can’t run.</p>
<p>Three Pocket-sized items equal a Handheld object; three Handheld-sized items equal a Portable object; and three Portable-sized items equal a Person-sized object. You could carry eight Handheld objects – say, a cutlass, a buckler, and a brace of six pistols tied together by rope – and not be slowed down, because that only equals two Portable items, which is less than a Person-sized object.</p>
<h5 id="worn-items">Worn Items</h5>
<p>Items that are specifically designed to be worn – and which can’t be removed easily during the middle of a fight (and sometimes, even after a fight) – count as one size lower for purposes of encumbrance when worn. A suit of armor is normally Person-sized, but if you’re wearing it, it counts as Portable-sized. (If you’re trying to carry an empty suit of armor, though, it counts as Person-sized.) A worn breastplate (Portable) counts as a Handheld item.</p>
<p>Pocket-sized items which are worn don’t count at all for encumbrance purposes, unless you’re wearing three of the same kind – for example, a worn wrist holster (Pocket) or two doesn’t weigh you down at all. Three worn wrist holsters, however, would equal a Pocket-sized objects – base size of Pocket, stepped up to Handheld for three of them, then stepped down again to Pocket size for being worn.</p>
<p>Clothing of any type never counts for calculating encumbrance – it’s all considered Pocket size (regardless of actual size) and thus is not included when worn unless you’re doing something silly like wearing three different capes at the same time.</p>
<h5 id="other-things-that-dont-weigh-very-much">Other Things That Don’t Weigh Very Much</h5>
<p>Medicine, alchemy supplies, draughts and unguents, poisons, and other small consumables don’t count for encumbrance unless you’ve got 9 of them, in which case they count as a Pocket-sized object. Ammunition and powder for your guns, arrows for your crossbows and bows, and other types of ammo don’t ever count; they’re included with the weapon itself (especially as they’re not tracked in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>).</p>
<p>Other supplies (art supplies, blackpowder supplies, clockwork gears, fabric, foodstuffs) count as one Pocket-size object for every three units you carry. So if you’re carrying, say, 10 units of clockwork gears, that counts as three Pocket-size objects, or 1 Handheld object. Two or fewer units of these supplies don’t count for encumbrance purposes.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-1">Wealth</h3>
<p>In <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, money is treated as an abstract resource rather than counting the exact number of Crowns, Sols, and Lunes that your character is carrying. Your character’s ability to purchase items is represented by a composite Wealth pool, and goods or services are rated by cost and availability.</p>
<h5 id="wealth-pools">Wealth Pools</h5>
<p>A Wealth score for a player character is a pool based on the following dice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character’s two Social Rank scores</li>
<li>The character’s Competency Die</li>
</ul>
<p>A new Duelist/Charmweaver character would thus have a Wealth dice pool consisting of 1D6 (Soldier social rank), 1D8 (Artisan social rank), and 1D6 (starting Competency die), for a total of 1D8+2D6.</p>
<p>Wealth pools can become depleted by making successful Wealth rolls during the course of a game session, as described below. At the start of each session, a character’s Wealth pool is restored to its original value.</p>
<h5 id="purchase-costs-and-availability">Purchase Costs and Availability</h5>
<p>Each item or service that you can buy has a cost, as shown on the equipment lists. For example, a dagger is 1D0, a leather jerkin is 1D6, and an airship is 4D12.</p>
<p>The availability of the item is dependent upon where you are and how common the item is, as determined by the MJ based on the following table.</p>
<h6 id="availability">Availability</h6>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Availability</th>
<th>Die</th>
<th>Skill Required</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Very Common</td>
<td>D0</td>
<td>Apprentice</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Common</td>
<td>D6</td>
<td>Journeyman</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Uncommon</td>
<td>D8</td>
<td>Expert</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Rare</td>
<td>D10</td>
<td>Master</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Very Rare</td>
<td>D12</td>
<td>Grandmaster</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are no set values for availability, but as a general rule the highest die in an item’s cost is often equal to its availability rating, or the level of skill required to create the item, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>The MJ can change the availability based on the geographic location; for example, if you are in Lutetia, it’s Very Common to find a sword, while in the Provinces it might be Very Common to buy a draft horse.</p>
<p>The dice pool opposing a Wealth roll is equal to the cost plus the availability. Buying a sword in Lutetia would be D6 (cost) plus D0 (availability), or 1D6. Buying an Airship in Lutetia is 4D12 (cost) plus 1D12 (availability), or 5D12, since airships are very rarely available for purchase.</p>
<h5 id="making-a-wealth-roll">Making a Wealth Roll</h5>
<p>A Wealth roll represents the character’s attempt to locate goods or services, leverage her material assets and personal favors, and purchase said item. The player makes a roll of her Wealth pool against the cost and availability, rolled by the MJ.</p>
<p>If the MJ’s roll is higher, the character is unable to purchase the item in question – her personal lines of credit are exhausted, she’s low on cash, there’s not one available for the right price, or any other explanation. This is an opportunity for the MJ and the player to cooperatively introduce a plot element to describe why the purchase didn’t go through.</p>
<p>In addition, on a failed Wealth roll, the character drops one die from her Wealth pool. This is marked on the character sheet by a checkbox. Dropped dice cannot be used again during the same game session, although they are restored at the beginning of the next game session.</p>
<p>If the player wins the opposed Wealth roll, she still drops one die from her Wealth pool to represent the expenditure of resources, and spends her success points on the following success table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Wealth Rolls</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td>Cost and availability</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>+</td>
<td>Purchase Item</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>++++</td>
<td>No Drop</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Purchase Item:</strong> You can purchase the item or service in question. If the item has a B beside the cost, it can be purchased in bulk, and each success point you spend gives you one more of the item; otherwise, you can only purchase the item or service once.</p>
<p><strong>No Drop:</strong> You don’t drop a die from your Wealth pool because of this roll.</p>
<h6 id="dropped-dice">Dropped Dice</h6>
<p>Dropped dice are restored at the start of the next game session. You can (and probably should) drop a D0 die if it is in your Wealth pool; it’s always best to drop your lowest die rather your highest die.</p>
<p>If you get enough success points on your Wealth roll, you don’t have to drop any dice.</p>
<p>You can’t choose to drop Barter or Reward dice when you make a Wealth roll, as they are not a permanent part of your Wealth pool.</p>
<h6 id="buying-in-bulk">Buying in Bulk</h6>
<p>Certain items in the equipment list can be purchased in bulk; these are marked by a [B] after the cost. For those items, and only those items, you can buy multiple quantities by expending additional success points.</p>
<p>If you are spending a Reward, you get a quantity of items equal to half your Reward die size when buying items in bulk. For example, if you spend a D8 reward on fabric (cost D6), you get 4 pieces of fabric.</p>
<h6 id="charmwoven-items">Charmwoven Items</h6>
<p>You purchase a Charmwoven item in the same way that you purchase anything else – but the cost is equal to the base cost of the item plus the Charm die. This is in addition to the availability, which in most cases is equal to the Charm die as well.</p>
<p>For example, if you wish to purchase a cavalier hat with a D8 Charm for Dueling (Riposte), the cost will be D6 for the hat, D8 for the Charm, and D8 for finding an Expert charmweaver, for a total of 2D8+1D6 as the opposition to your Wealth roll.</p>
<p>By comparison, an uncharmed cavalier hat would cost D6 plus D0 availability in Lutetia (they’re all the rage these days), for a total of 1D6.</p>
<h6 id="cost-d0">Cost D0</h6>
<p>An item with a cost of D0 is not free; it still requires a successful Wealth roll to purchase and thus a die dropped (or a D0 or higher Reward to purchase without rolling).</p>
<p>Likewise, a D0 Reward actually is something, but it doesn’t do much except let you purchase a single D0 item (such as a knife).</p>
<p>A D0 Barter die has no value, however, so you don’t need to bother with those.</p>
<h5 id="barter-dice">Barter Dice</h5>
<p>When you sell items, you gain Barter dice equal to the cost (not the availability) of the item. Barter dice are recorded on the character sheet below the Wealth pool, and can be included in a Wealth roll whenever you wish. However, after being successfully used once, Barter dice are expended.</p>
<p>You can include as many Barter dice as you have in any given roll, or you can save them as long as you wish.</p>
<p>On a failed Wealth roll, any Barter dice used are not expended, and can be used again in the future.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to sell your riding horse (cost D8), you gain a D8 Barter die. If you then turn around and buy a warhorse, you can choose to add the D8 to your Wealth roll.</p>
<h5 id="rewards">Rewards</h5>
<p>A Reward is a more tangible, less abstract quantity of Wealth, usually bequeathed by a non-player character. Such Rewards could include a grant from the Queen, a bounty for capturing a wanted criminal, or a prize for winning a tournament.</p>
<p>Each Reward has a die value associated with it, from D0 to D12. You can use a Reward to automatically purchase, without making a Wealth roll, any item or service which is equal to or less than the Reward’s die value.</p>
<p>New characters begin the game with three Rewards, equal in value to the dice in their Wealth pool. Additional Rewards should be granted by the MJ. A typical good deed may net a Reward equal to the player characters’ Competency die, while capturing a fugitive could earn a Reward equaling the criminal’s Competency die.</p>
<h5 id="gallinean-currency">Gallinean Currency</h5>
<p>The most common coinage used in Gallinea is the Sol, a silver coin roughly analogous to a modern dollar. A Lune is a copper coin equal to 1/12 of a Sol, while a gold Crown is 12 Sols.</p>
<p>Crowns are stamped with a portrait of the current monarch. Sols have a sun pattern, and Lunes show a crescent moon.</p>
<p>The approximate values of an item, Barter die, or Reward are shown on the following table.</p>

<p>These numbers are just to facilitate roleplay; you don’t use the actual values except for description. For example, the MJ might say, “She plunks down a small sack of Crowns on the table” to represent a D8 reward, or state that an airship (cost 4D12) is worth nearly 5,000 Crowns.</p>
<p>Gallinea’s neighboring countries have their own currencies but they are usually interchangeable with Gallinean coins as they’re based on the ancient Qartan money system.</p>
<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
<p>While <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> is not entirely focused around combat, it’s still a swashbuckling game – so swords, muskets, and cannons play a role in the stories being told.</p>
<p>In game terms, there are three broad categories that weapons fall into: dueling, aimed, and explosive.</p>
<p><strong>Dueling Weapon:</strong> A weapon that can be used in close-quarters combat with one or more of the Dueling (Lunge), Dueling (Riposte), Dueling (Feint), or Defense (Parry) specialties. Examples are swords, knives, quarterstaves, and pikes.</p>
<p><strong>Aimed Weapon:</strong> A weapon that can be used at range with the Military (Aim) specialty. These include crossbows, muskets, pistols, and some thrown weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Explosive Weapon:</strong> Unlike some aimed weapons which also use blackpowder, such as flintlock pistols or muskets, aiming an explosive weapon isn’t the problem. It’s preventing yourself from blowing up in the process. To make an attack with explosives, you use the Science (Blackpowder) specialty. This category includes cannons, grenades, and bombs.</p>
<h6 id="free-starting-weapon">Free Starting Weapon</h6>
<p>When you create your character for <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, you get a free weapon in addition to any granted by your classes and any additional weapons you might also buy. If you don’t want a free weapon, you can instead take a +1D6 Barter die.</p>
<p>You can pick from the following basic weapons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutlass (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)</li>
<li>Dagger (Knife +1D6, Either Hand)</li>
<li>Flintlock Pistol (Pistol +1D6, Either Hand)</li>
<li>Rapier (Sword +1D8, Main Hand)</li>
<li>Sabre (Sword +1D6, Main Hand, Cavalry)</li>
<li>Smallsword (Sword +1D6, Either Hand)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weapon-qualities-1">Weapon Qualities</h4>
<p>There are four qualities possessed by all weapons: the type of Weapon Prowess needed to use it, the Weapon Die that can be added as an Item Die to your dice pools, the number of Hands you need to use to attack effectively with one, and the Specialties with which that weapon can be used. Some weapons also possess Success Table Additions which give you additional ways to spend success points when making certain kinds of rolls with the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Prowess:</strong> Weapon Prowess is your knowledge of the basics of how to attack and defend with that weapon. There are nine types of Weapon Prowess: bow, cudgel, knife, musket, net, pistol, polearm, sword, and whip. All player characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> automatically have Knife Prowess.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Die:</strong> You can add the Weapon Die to a Dice Pool as an Item Die if you have the appropriate prowess for the weapon. If you lack prowess in a weapon, you can still use the weapon – you just don’t get to add the Weapon Die to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>Hands:</strong> Some weapons can be used freely in either hand, others require two hands to use, and some are just intended for main-hand use. These are represented by the following weapon qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Hand:</strong> This weapon can be used in one hand. You can have another weapon in your other hand, but it must be usable in Either Hand.</li>
<li><strong>Either Hand:</strong> This weapon also requires only one hand to use, but unlike a Main Hand weapon, you can wield one in each hand (known as “dual wielding”) or as a secondary weapon with a Main Hand weapon in your primary hand.</li>
<li><strong>Both Hands:</strong> You need both hands to use this weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> The scale of a weapon depends on the number of hands required to use it. Unless stated otherwise, Main Hand weapons are considered handheld scale, Either Hand weapons are pocket scale, and Both Hand weapons are portable scale.</p>
<p><strong>Specialties:</strong> These qualities list the specific specialties that can be used with that weapon. If a specialty isn’t listed, it’s up to the MJ whether it’s possible to use the weapon that way, and what kind of Drop penalty you’ll receive; for example, using Parry with a musket or Aim with a rapier could have pretty heavy penalties – Drop 2 for the musket, Drop 4 for the rapier.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim:</strong> Any attack with handheld weapons made at range uses the Aim specialty, from throwing a knife to firing a musket. If you have prowess in the weapon you’re using, you can add its Weapon Die to your Aim roll as an Item Die.</li>
<li><strong>Block:</strong> Defense (Block) allows the use of armor and general toughness to throw off the effects of an attack. It can be used to negate attacks from either Dueling or Aimed weapons. You add your armor’s Armor Die to your Block roll as an Item Die if you have Armor Prowess in that item.</li>
<li><strong>Brawl:</strong> Only a few Dueling weapons can be used as part of a Military (Brawl) attack or defense; Brawl usually doesn’t use an Item Die of any kind. Brawl can be used to inflict Yield, to disarm or knock down an opponent, or to defend against a Brawl attack.</li>
<li><strong>Feint:</strong> The primary use of Dueling (Feint) is to build Advantage during a fight through tricky maneuvering or a false attack to draw the your opponent off-guard. It can also inflict Yield or trigger a Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you’re using, you can add its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die, although you can perform a Feint without a weapon also.</li>
<li><strong>Lunge:</strong> A Lunge is a straightforward attack against an opponent using a Dueling weapon, usually by stabbing, chopping, slashing, or bashing. It’s the best way to inflict either Yield or Wounds on your target. If you have prowess in the weapon you’re using, add its Weapon Die to your Lunge roll as an Item Die.</li>
<li><strong>Parry:</strong> This specialty of the Defense skill can be used to negate incoming attacks from Dueling weapons, and if possible, trigger a Riposte. You need to have a weapon, improvised or otherwise, in your hand to attempt a Parry. If you have prowess in that weapon, add its Weapon Die to your Parry roll as an Item Die.</li>
<li><strong>Riposte:</strong> Dueling (Riposte) is a triggered Dueling attack that you can use by spending success points from another specialty – either Defense (Parry) or Dueling (Feint). A successful Riposte can inflict Yield or Wounds, or decrease your opponent’s Advantage. The Defense (Parry) specialty cannot be used to defend against a Riposte. If you have prowess in the weapon you’re using, you can add its Weapon Die to your Riposte roll as an Item Die.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Success Table Additions:</strong> Some weapons have additions to the success tables for specific specialties, such as Knockdown or additional damage. These are represented by the + notation for success points, such as Lunge (+++: Unhorse).</p>
<h4 id="dueling-weapons">Dueling Weapons</h4>
<p>Dueling weapons are, by definition, weapons that can be used with the Dueling skill and its specialties – Lunge, Riposte, Feint, and Defense (Parry). Not all weapons can be used with all specialties, however.</p>
<p><strong>Dueling Weapon Prowess:</strong> The types of Weapon Prowess used with dueling weapons are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cudgel Prowess:</strong> Any Dueling weapon used to bludgeon someone is a cudgel.</li>
<li><strong>Knife Prowess:</strong> In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.</li>
<li><strong>Net Prowess:</strong> A net can be used as a Dueling weapon, although it’s much more common to see this in Ekalia than in Gallinea.</li>
<li><strong>Polearm Prowess:</strong> A polearm is any long-hafted Dueling weapon, typically (but not always) with the Reach quality.</li>
<li><strong>Sword Prowess:</strong> A Dueling weapon with a blade and a hilt. The pointy end goes in the other guy.</li>
<li><strong>Whip Prowess:</strong> Whips are usually used in one hand, and most have Reach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dueling Weapon Qualities:</strong> In addition to the qualities common to all weapons, dueling weapons could have two additional qualities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cavalry:</strong> A dueling weapon with the Cavalry quality must be used with your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding a mount, you can substitute the mount’s Item Die for your Weapon Die against an unmounted opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Reach:</strong> A dueling weapon with Reach can be used to attack into an adjacent area as well as your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Success Table Additions for Dueling Weapons:</strong> Some dueling weapons have additions to the success tables for specific specialties, such as Knockdown or additional damage. These are represented by the + notation for success points after the specialty name, such as Lunge (+++: Unhorse). On a success with a weapon possessing that quality, you could spend 3 success points to knock your target off her horse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Break Weapon:</strong> You snap your target’s blade or hilt. You can only do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or if you are performing a Parry yourself. A broken weapon is useless except as an improvised weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Disarm:</strong> You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to attack you or the weapon she’s using to Parry your attack. (This can’t be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.</li>
<li><strong>Execute a Riposte:</strong> You can make a Riposte attack. This is the only way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful use of a Specialty or weapon with this effect on its Success Table.</li>
<li><strong>Grab:</strong> You can snag an item worn by your target as long as you can see it, the item is Handheld size or smaller, and it’s not being held by your opponent. You get to choose if the item ends up on the ground in your Area, or in your hand if you have one free.</li>
<li><strong>Inflict 1 Wound:</strong> Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a lower cost than usual.</li>
<li><strong>Inflict 2 Wounds:</strong> Your opponent takes two Wounds. If she takes more Wounds than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is dying. Weapons with this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a lower cost than usual.</li>
<li><strong>Knockdown:</strong> Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in an adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up; standing up is a Drop 1 combined action.</li>
<li><strong>Restrain:</strong> You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon, holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional Success Points you spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4. Your opponent can escape by making a simple check against Standard Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon attack. On a success, your opponent can break your weapon, let it fall in their Area, or grab it themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Unhorse:</strong> If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that mount and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your mount can make a trample attack right now for free, if it has that quality. Prone characters suffer a Drop 1 penalty on attack and defense rolls, and cannot Move until they stand up. Standing up is a Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3 penalty.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="availability-of-dueling-weapons">Availability of Dueling Weapons</h5>
<p>As stated in Chapter 7: Wealth, to purchase any item you must roll against a pool consisting of that item’s availability and its cost.</p>
<p>Common dueling weapons are those which aren’t hard at all to find any settlement of decent size, and even in some smaller towns. Those are listed in the following tables.</p>
<p>The availability of common weapons is almost always 1D0 in settlements of any size. The exceptions are cutlass, rapier, sabre, and smallsword – the common swords – in a small rural settlement. In such situations, the availability increases to 1D6.</p>

</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buckler:</strong> A buckler is a small shield that can be strapped to your forearm, usually on your non-dominant hand. You can hold an item in that hand but trying to attack with that hand while wearing a buckler gives you a Drop 2 penalty on rolls using either the buckler or that weapon.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Club:</strong> A standard club is simply a piece of wood or metal that you can swing at someone. It’s not very sophisticated, but then again, you can likely pick one up wherever you are at any given time.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Cutlass:</strong> The favored weapon of buccaneers, pirates, and other sailors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dagger:</strong> A dagger is a large knife that can also be thrown using the Aim specialty.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Quarterstaff:</strong> A medium-sized pole wielded in both hands that can also be used in a Brawl dice pool as well.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Rapier:</strong> The most common type of Sword in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> is a sharp, pointy weapon that can be used for all types of fencing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Sabre:</strong> A lighter and faster weapon, the sabre is designed to be used from horseback although it functions equally well when dismounted.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Smallsword:</strong> Effectively a smaller, lighter version of a rapier, a smallsword can be used in the same way – or you could dual-wield two of them if you want.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Uncommon dueling weapons have an availability of 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and 1D8 in villages and other rural areas. The one exception is that a bullwhip always has an availability of 1D0.</p>

<h6 id="foreign-weapons">Foreign Weapons</h6>
<p>In addition to the common and uncommon dueling weapons listed in the previous tables and aimed weapons later in this chapter, the nations that comprise Elara and Ifran have their own weapons as well. These national weapons are described in chapters 14 and 15, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Albia:</strong> claymore, dirk, longbow, tuck<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Ekalia:</strong> brandestoc, cinquedea, hook prothesis<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Northern Ifran:</strong> horsebow, jambiya, shamshir<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Ondala:</strong> espada ropera, montante<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Talania:</strong> koncerz, szabla<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Varendia:</strong> colichedemarde, katzbalger, zweihander<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>The availability of foreign dueling weapons is the same as that of uncommon weapons – 1D0 in a capital city, 1D6 in any other city, and 1D8 in villages – at least, when you’re in that foreign country.</p>
<p>For neighboring countries, the availability of foreign dueling weapons is 1D6 in a capital city, 1D8 in any other city, and 1D12 in villages. In far-distant countries, the availability increases to 1D8 in a capital city, 1D12 in any other city, and unavailable in smaller settlements.</p>
<h4 id="aimed-weapons">Aimed Weapons</h4>
<p>An Aimed weapon is one that can be used with the Military (Aim) specialty. Larger ranged weapons are usually explosive weapons and use the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Aimed Weapon Prowess:</strong> There are five types of weapon prowess that are used with Aimed weapons. You can add the weapon’s Item Die to the dice pool when making an attack roll with Aim if you have the appropriate weapon prowess.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bow Prowess:</strong> Bows, including crossbows, use the Aim specialty to attack, and fire arrows or bolts.</li>
<li><strong>Knife Prowess:</strong> In addition to serving as Dueling weapons, you can also throw some knives with the Aim specialty.</li>
<li><strong>Musket Prowess:</strong> Muskets are an Aimed weapon with longer range than pistols, usually doing more damage and taking longer to reload.</li>
<li><strong>Pistol Prowess:</strong> An Aimed pistol can be fired with one hand.</li>
<li><strong>Polearm Prowess:</strong> Apart from their use as dueling weapons, some polearms – namely, spears – can be thrown with the Aim skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aimed Weapon Qualities: In addition to the qualities common to all weapons, there are five that apply to Aimed weapons: the time needed to reload, and the effectiveness of the weapon at close, short, medium, and long ranges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reload:</strong> For Aimed weapons that require ammunition, the Reload quality indicates what kind of Drop penalty is imposed when combining the Reload action with another action. Most muskets have a Reload value of Drop 3, and pistols of Drop 2.</li>
<li><strong>Close</strong> Range<strong>:</strong> The Close Range quality is the Drop penalty imposed when firing an Aimed weapon at a target within your own area. Larger weapons such as bows or muskets tend to have a Drop penalty at Close Range.</li>
<li><strong>Short</strong> Range<strong>:</strong> A target that is one or two areas away is at Short Range. With very few exceptions, nearly all Aimed weapons have no Drop penalty at Short Range.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> Range<strong>:</strong> Medium Range is three or four areas. Most Aimed weapons have a Drop penalty at Medium Range. If a weapon doesn’t have a listed Medium Range, it can’t be used to effectively attack at that distance.</li>
<li><strong>Long Range:</strong> At five or more areas distant, a target is at Long Range. All Aimed weapons that can be used at this distance have at least a Drop 1 penalty. If there is no Long Range listed for a weapon, it can’t be used to attack at Long Range.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="maximum-range">Maximum Range?</h6>
<p>The tables below don’t specify a maximum distance for long range. That’s because areas are an abstract representation of distance, not exact measurements. Under ideal conditions, a weapon that has the long range quality could reach 10 or more areas away, depending on how the areas are set up for that encounter; in a crowded city street, the effective range will be much lower.</p>
<p>Ultimately it’s up to the MJ to decide what the maximum effective range is for any weapon used at extreme long range, although usually not more than 10 areas.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arbalest:</strong> Also known as a heavy crossbow, the arbalest is harder to use than a common crossbow but packs a larger punch.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Arquebus:</strong> A smaller and lighter musket with shorter range and less firepower.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Blunderbuss:</strong> The flared barrel of this musket makes it easier to reload, but also reduces its effective range.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Caliver:</strong> Another type of musket that can reload faster without the reduced range of the blunderbuss, but with a smaller Weapon Die.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Composite Bow:</strong> A heavier bow with longer effective range and pull.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Crossbow:</strong> The crossbow uses stored mechanical power to fire bolts, instead of relying upon personal muscle power as a normal bow does.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Double Musket:</strong> The primary advantage of this double-barreled musket is the ability to fire twice, once per barrel, without reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D12, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it’s harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double musket with a Drop 3 action.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Double Pistol:</strong> Like the double musket, the double pistol allows one shot per barrel without having to reload. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the Weapon Die increases to 1D8, but you take a Drop 1 penalty because it’s harder to aim. You can reload just one barrel of a double pistol with a Drop 2 action.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dragon:</strong> This heavier version of a pistol is favored by cavalry – especially Dragoons, who take their name from the use of this large pistol.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Flintlock Musket:</strong> This is a standard musket used by infantry throughout Elara.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Flintlock Pistol:</strong> A single-barrel pistol found all over Elara and Ifran.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Hunting Bow:</strong> This standard bow, also called a shortbow or flatbow, has been used for millennia in pretty much every nation.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Rifled Musket:</strong> With a rifled barrel to provide better accuracy at long range, this musket is the favored weapon of snipers.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Thrown Dagger:</strong> A dagger doesn’t have be reloaded, but you take a Drop 1 penalty to draw it as you would with any other weapon – and once it’s thrown, you don’t have it any more.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Thrown Spear:</strong> Like a dagger, a thrown spear must be drawn first but doesn’t require ammunition.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="ammunition">Ammunition</h6>
<p>Firing a musket or pistol uses a small amount of blackpowder and a bullet, while a bow requires an arrow. However, in the <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, strict tracking of ammunition and powder doesn’t contribute to the swashbuckling adventure style of the genre. If you have an Aimed weapon that has a Reload value, you’re assumed to have enough powder, bullets, or arrows to fire your weapon and reload it as many times as necessary. This applies even if you use someone else’s weapon, or a weapon you just picked up – you just don’t track ammo for Aimed weapons in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>. Except, of course, for explosive weapons.</p>
<h4 id="explosive-weapons">Explosive Weapons</h4>
<p>Unlike conventional weapons, which use Dueling or Military (Aim) rolls for attack, explosive weapons affect an entire area and inflict damage on every creature, object, or other target within that area.</p>

<h3 id="armor">Armor</h3>
<p>Armor is any kind of clothing or shield used to protect the wearer from attacks. Unlike normal clothing, most types of armor can’t be enchanted by charmweaving. Armor provides an item die, also known as an Armor Die, that can be used on Block rolls. As with all other item dice, you can’t include more than one Armor Die in any dice pools.</p>
<p>There are three types of armor: Flexible, Rigid, and Shield. Each type has its own associated armor prowess; if you wear armor of that type but lack the appropriate prowess, you take a Drop 2 penalty on all combat rolls (Defense, Dueling, Brawl, Aim).</p>
<p><strong>Flexible armor: </strong>This type of armor is usually lighter and more comfortable to wear, although it may not fully protect the wearer. If you are wearing flexible armor, you can’t wear an additional article of clothing on your torso (although all armor includes sufficient undergarments for the armor to be worn).</p>
<p><strong>Rigid armor:</strong> Solid plates of steel or iron provide the defensive value of a suit of rigid armor. Like flexible armor, you can wear either armor or torso attire, but not both.</p>
<p><strong>Shields:</strong> A shield is carried in one hand and can be used for both Block and Parry rolls. You can’t include more than one Armor Die in any dice pool, so you can’t combine the Armor Dice of a shield and armor.</p>
<p>The following table lists the types of armor commonly found in Gallinea; each of these would have a +1D0 Availability Die in major cities, and +1D6 elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buckler: </strong>A buckler is a type of small shield commonly used in dueling, usually paired with a rapier or other sword. They’re good at deflecting blows as well as setting up an opponent for a riposte.</li>
<li><strong>Leather jerkin: </strong>One of the most commonly worn armors, leather jerkins are simply leather vests or jackets reinforced with cuir bouilli shoulders and chest plates. While some can be decorated with artistic designs (for twice the price), the leather material can’t support the enchantments needed for charmweaving.</li>
<li><strong>Steel breastplate: </strong>A hard, steel breastplate, also known as a cuirass, protects the vital organs of its wearer, with the exception of the head. As with most armor, you can’t wear both a breastplate and an article of torso clothing, and the armor doesn’t support charmweaving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some less common armors are shown below. Each has an Availability Die in a city that equals its cost, and one or more steps higher in smaller towns.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buff coat:</strong> Essentially a longer, reinforced gambeson, buff coats are favored by military officers. As with gambesons, they have charmwoven enchants; they are Soldier (1D6) social rank, can take Military (Brawl, Aim, or Strategy) charms, and are available in the full range of colors used in charmweaving. (See Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment,” for further details on charmweaving.)</li>
<li><strong>Gambeson: </strong>Thick cloth padding makes these jerkins equal to leather in protective value, but the slightly longer construction time means they see less use. However, they can have charmwoven enchants added. Gambesons are considered to be Soldier (1D6) social rank, can have Defense (Block, Parry, or Dodge) charms added, and are only available in neutral colors. (See Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment,” for further details on charmweaving.)</li>
<li><strong>Kite shield:</strong> Also known as a heater shield, this is larger than a buckler. The size prevents you from effectively using any Main Hand weapon at the same time as the shield.</li>
<li><strong>Maille hauberk: </strong>This is a jacket or vest made of chainmail. The protective benefits in modern Gallinea are outweighed by the time – and thus the cost – necessary to produce it.</li>
<li><strong>Morion:</strong> This is an open-faced, steel helmet shaped somewhat like a hat with a ridge down the middle. Morions are favored by guards and infantry. While it gives minimal protection when used alone, it grants a +1D6 Bonus Die to Block rolls if you’re wearing a steel breastplate. You can’t wear an article of head attire while wearing a morion.</li>
<li><p><strong>Parade armor: </strong>These are highly decorative suits of plate armor, each one individually made for its wearer. (They’re only available in major cities, and even then usually have a +1D12 Availability Die.) Like other suits of plate armor, the wearer takes a Drop 2 penalty on Defense (Dodge), Dueling (Feint), and Nature (Prowl) rolls when parade armor is worn.</p>
<p>While the actual protective value of parade armor is less than a suit of plate armor, they are the only type of rigid armor that can take charms. Parade armor is Noble (1D10) social rank and can be made in any color. The helmet, breastplate, gauntlets, and boots can each have individual charms. See Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment,” for more information on charmweaving.</p>
Parade armor helmet charms can be Culture (Arts, Etiquette, Scholarship) or Observation (Perceive, Intuition, Deduce); breastplate charms can be Defense (Block, Parry, Dodge) or Interaction (Inspire, Negotiate, Deceive); gauntlet charms can be Military (Brawl, Aim, Strategy) or Streetwise (Banter, Carouse, Larceny); and boot charms can be Nature (Explore, Husbandry, Prowl) or Dueling (Lunge, Parry, Riposte). The entire suit of parade armor must be worn or none of the charms are active.</li>
<li><strong>Plate armor: </strong>The knights of Varendia are famous for their heavy plate armor, which does provide superior protective ability albeit at the expense of mobility. While you are wearing plate armor, you take a Drop 2 penalty on Dodge, Feint, and Prowl rolls. In addition, you can’t wear any additional articles of clothing save for shoulder items such as cloaks or tabards.</li>
<li><p><strong>Valmain-rivet:</strong> Originally created in Varendia (“valmain” references an older Albian term meaning “Varendish”), these are cheap, easily constructed suits of partial plate armor used for equipping large armies. There’s nothing glamorous about them; they’re simply functional. You can’t wear torso, head, or arm clothing items while wearing valmain-rivet.</p></li>

<h3 id="alchemical-items">Alchemical Items</h3>
<p>Characters with the Magicks (Brew) specialty can produce draughts, salves, and concoctions.</p>
<h4 id="draughts">Draughts</h4>
<p>Imbibing a draught is a Drop 1 combined action if the item is in hand; the effects last until the end of the scene. Draughts with increased potency have a cost equal to the die value; e.g., a D10 Aggression Draught has a cost of D10.</p>
<p>Draughts provide a Charm die bonus on a given specialty. Since you can only include one Charm die in a given dice pool, a character can’t benefit from both the draught and a charmwoven item that affect the same specialty, only one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="clockworks-3">Clockworks</h3>
<h4 id="clockwork-devices">Clockwork Devices</h4>
<p>Each device consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Casing</li>
<li>1 or more Power Sources</li>
<li>1 or more Components</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gear Space:</strong> Each casing has a certain amount of gear space available, depending upon its size. The power source and the components use up that space once installed. A miniaturization component can be installed in a casing to increase its effective gear space.</p>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> Each power source delivers a set amount of power, dependent on the type of power source and the method of producing that power. Each component consumes a specified amount of power, and the power source’s output must be enough to cover the power used by the components. Power is measured in power units.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> The complexity of a device is equal to the number of power sources plus the number of components.</p>
<h4 id="constructing-a-device">Constructing a Device</h4>
<p><strong>Note: These rules are obsolute and this section needs to be rewritten to reflect the current crafting rules.</strong></p>
<p>There are five steps to creating a device:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Plan the Device</li>
<li>Purchase the Supplies</li>
<li>Build the Parts</li>
<li>Install the Parts</li>
<li>Complete the Device</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="plan-the-device">Plan the Device</h5>
<p>Before you start, you should plan out what you want your device to do. Decide how large the device will be – the size of its casing. Determine what capabilities it will have by the components you choose to install, and make sure that you have a strong enough power source to provide power to those components.</p>
<p>Once you have the device planned out, you can spend four hours to make a Science (Calculus) roll to draft a set of plans for building the device. This is optional, but is highly recommended as it gives you an additional die to roll when installing parts in your device and completing it.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the Science (Calculus) roll to draw plans is determined by the complexity of the device you are designing, as shown on the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> If you have an existing prototype for the device, either created by yourself or by someone else, you gain a bonus D6 die on the roll to draw plans. The prototype does not need to be currently functional for you to gain this bonus.</p>
<h5 id="purchase-the-supplies">Purchase the Supplies</h5>
<p>There are three ways to acquire the parts needed for constructing a device: build them yourself, buy them from another clockworker, or salvage the parts from another device.</p>
<p>If you are going to build your own parts, you will need to buy gear supplies. Make a Wealth roll against the cost and availability of gear supplies – D8 for the cost, and D6 availability unless you are in a large city (in which case the availability is D0). Each success point on the Wealth roll enables you to buy one unit of gear supplies since they are a bulk item.</p>
<p>If you are going to buy certain parts, you will also make a Wealth roll based on the cost of the part (casing, power source, or component) that you wish to purchase. The cost for each is listed in the descriptions of each part later in this chapter. A casing has an availability of D0, while power sources and components have an availability equal to the highest die of their costs.</p>
<p>For details on salvaging parts and supplies, see the later section on Salvage.</p>
<h5 id="build-the-parts">Build the Parts</h5>
<p>You can save money by building your own casing, although this does consume more time. A roll is not necessary, although you must have competency in the Science (Clockworks) specialty to construct a usable casing. See the later section on Constructing a Power Source for more information.</p>
<p>Building a power source or a component requires a number of gear supplies as shown on the table for that part, and at least four hours’ work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point’s worth of gear supplies to create components or power sources. Multiple rolls may be required to create all the parts needed for a complex device.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> The total number of gears that you can spend on a single part is limited to your number of specialty ranks in Science (Clockworks).</p>
<p><strong>Standard Opposition:</strong> The difficulty for this roll is Easy (3D6) if you are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong>If you have clockworker’s tools, you gain an item die (usually D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus instead.</p>
<p><strong>Plans:</strong> The plans for the overall device do not apply on this roll.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> You gain no bonus for having a prototype of the device when making this roll.</p>
<h5 id="install-the-parts">Install the Parts</h5>
<p>Installing a power source or component in a casing requires a Science (Clockworks) roll (or series of rolls). The difficulty is Easy (3D6) if you are in a workshop, or Hard (3D10) if you are not. Each roll takes four hours, and each success point installs one power source or component.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> If you have clockworker’s tools, you gain an item die (usually D6) on this roll. If you are in a workshop, you gain a D8 item bonus instead.</p>
<p><strong>Plans:</strong> If you have plans for the device, you gain a bonus die based on the quality of the plans when making this roll.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> If you have a prototype of the device, you gain a bonus D6 die on this roll. The prototype does not need to be currently functional for you to gain this bonus.</p>
<h5 id="complete-the-device">Complete the Device</h5>
<p>Once all the components have been successfully installed, the device needs to be completed. This requires no roll, but does require one hour of work per point of complexity of the device.</p>
<h4 id="casings">Casings</h4>
<p>Casings are measured by their physical size, which determines the amount of gear space within the casing.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing a Casing:</strong> Casings are either purchased at the cost shown below or constructed by the clockworker for no cost. The availability of a casing is always D0. Gear supplies cannot be spent on casing costs.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Casing:</strong> It takes one hour per point of Gear Space to create a casing. No skill roll is required, but the clockworker must have at least one rank in the Clockworks specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Casing Notation:</strong> A casing is described by listing the size of the casing followed by the gear space of that casing in parentheses. Examples: pocket (space 1), person (space 8), building (space 64).</p>

<h6 id="pocket-size">Pocket Size</h6>
<p>A pocket-sized device is easily concealed, requires only one hand to operate, and can be carried within a pocket or beneath clothing. Examples include pocketwatches and wrist holsters.</p>
<h6 id="handheld-size">Handheld Size</h6>
<p>A handheld device requires usually requires one hand to operate and can be carried on a belt, in a holster, or in a scabbard. Examples include clockwork pistols and gearswords.</p>
<h6 id="portable-size">Portable Size</h6>
<p>A portable device is one which requires two hands to carry and operate, or perhaps can be carried as a backpack. Most don’t need to be self-mobile. Examples include clockwork muskets and wing-gliders.</p>
<h6 id="person-size">Person Size</h6>
<p>An object roughly the size of a person – such as a statue – can’t be easily carried by a single person without requiring her full attention. Most are therefore either stationary devices or self-mobile. Examples include humanoid automata and velocipedes.</p>
<h6 id="carriage-size">Carriage Size</h6>
<p>Larger than a human but smaller than a room, carriage-sized devices are on the scale of large pieces of furniture. Unless self-mobile, they require several people in order to transport. Examples include clockwork carriages and some industrial machines.</p>
<h6 id="room-size">Room Size</h6>
<p>Room-sized devices take up the entire space of a sizable room, and are therefore rarely portable unless self-mobile. Examples include some analytical engines and most watermills.</p>
<h6 id="building-size">Building Size</h6>
<p>Devices the size of a building are usually as large as a two or three story building with a half-dozen rooms. Examples include airships and clock towers.</p>
<h4 id="power-sources">Power Sources</h4>
<p>Power sources are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing, by how much power they can provide, and by how that power is activated to enable components.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing a Power Source:</strong> A power source can be purchased, pre-assembled, for the cost shown on the table for that power source. The availability is equal to the highest cost die of the power source.</p>
<p><strong>Constructing a Power Source:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, a power source can be constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear supplies as shown on the table for that power source, and at least four hours’ work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point’s worth of gear supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a single power source is limited to her number of specialty ranks in Science (Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with Science (Clockworks) +3 can only spend 3 gears on creating a mainspring power source.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> There are a few power sources that cannot be constructed using the Clockworks specialty. This will be noted in the description of the power source along with information about the required skill for construction. The roll is otherwise treated like the Clockworks specialty roll.</p>
<p><strong>Power Source Notation:</strong> A power source is described by listing the name of the power source followed by the space, power supply, other qualities of the power source, and the duration. Examples: gear train (space 1, power supply 2, Drop 1, one action); mainspring (space 4, power supply 4, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes); tension trigger (space 1, power supply 2, reset Drop 2, one use).</p>
<h6 id="alchemical-capacitor">Alchemical Capacitor</h6>
<p>An alchemical capacitor is a simple jar device that is used to generate, capture, and store electrical energy through alchemical means. A crude electromechanical interface allows the energy of the capacitor to be released and used over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Each alchemical capacitor functions for 24 hours before needing to be replaced and reinstalled in a device. The power supply’s duration is the same if it is used once during that time period or used repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>Creating an Alchemical Capacitor:</strong> The Magicks (Brew) specialty is required to create an alchemical capacitor, and it requires the use of alchemical supplies to do so. The maximum number of alchemical supplies that can be spent to create an alchemical capacitor is equal to the brewer’s ranks in Magicks (Brew).</p>

<h6 id="gear-train">Gear Train</h6>
<p>A gear train is used to transmit mechanical energy to a device as part of the same action that uses the device; this mechanical energy is supplied by the muscular activity of the device’s user. This activity is a combined action that imposes a Drop 4 to Drop 0 penalty on that action. The power thus supplied is only good for that specific action.</p>
<p>For example, a velocipede might have a Drop1 penalty required to provide 3 units of power, which can then be used to power the carry and movement components of the velocipede. This imposes that Drop 1 penalty on actions undertaken by the rider of the velocipede during the turn in which it’s ridden.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Gear Train:</strong> The power units and the drop penalty of any given gear train are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A gear train (space 0, power supply 2, Drop 2) will always supply 2 power units and require a Drop 2 penalty to operate. However, a gear train can be made variable by increasing the space by 1 and the cost by D6 (1 gear); this allows variable power supply based on the amount of Drop penalty taken to power it. For example, a variable gear train (space 0+1, power supply 1/2/3, Drop 1/2/4) supplies 1 power unit if a Drop 1 penalty is applied, 2 power units for a Drop 2 penalty, and 3 power units for a Drop 4 penalty.</p>

<h6 id="mainspring">Mainspring</h6>
<p>A mainspring is a complex clockwork spring used to store power until it needs to be released. The initial power is put into the mainspring by winding it and then is released by a mechanical flywheel.</p>
<p>The capabilities of a mainspring are measured in both how much power is provided and how that power is stored and released; each factor is purchased separately as shown on the tables below. To design a mainspring, you need to determine both the power output and the duration separately, paying the cost (in wealth rolls or gear supplies) for each.</p>
<p>A mainspring can’t be wound for more than 10 minutes; at that point, the mainspring is holding the full amount of power that it is able to store and release.</p>
<p><strong>One Turn Winding/One Use per Success Point Duration:</strong> If the winding time is one turn and the duration is one use per success point, make a Science (Clockworks) check against Easy (3D6) standard difficulty. Each success point grants one use of the device before the end of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Mainspring:</strong> The winding time and duration any given mainspring are usually fixed, as shown on the table below. A mainspring (space 1, power supply 1, wind 1 minute, duration 10 minutes) will always require 1 minute of winding and provide 10 minutes of power. However, a mainspring can be made variable by increasing the space by 1 and the cost by D6 (1 gear); this allows variable duration based on the amount of time spent winding it. For example, a variable mainspring (space 1+1, power supply 1, wind 1 turn/1 minute/10 minutes, duration 1 minute/10 minutes/1 hour) supplies power for 1 minute if wound for 1 turn, 10 minutes if wound for 1 minute, and 1 hour if wound for 10 minutes.</p>

<h6 id="naturalistic-turbine">Naturalistic Turbine</h6>
<p>A naturalistic turbine is one that is hooked up to a source of power that exists in the natural world – running water, winds, or tidal flow. Naturalistic turbines produce a steady but low amount of power, without requiring any special actions or fuel to make them function. Setting up a naturalistic turbine to use any given natural energy supply requires one hour per power unit produced, so most are installed in permanent locations such as windmills or watermills.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Limits:</strong> A stream can produce up to 2 power units, while larger rivers can supply up to 4. Wind power varies between 0 and 3 power units in most situations. Tidal flow usually only can provide 1 power unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sails:</strong> A sail takes up half the space of a normal naturalistic turbine, but the power supplied can only be used for movement. It also requires the purchase of one unit of fabric supplies per power unit.</p>

<h6 id="phlogistone-furnace">Phlogistone Furnace</h6>
<p>A phlogistone furnace burns the rare mineral phlogistone to use for generating lift and propulsion. It is primarily used in airships and can be prohibitively expensive for other uses.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Power:</strong> Power units produced by a phlogistone furnace can only be used to power carry and movement components.</p>
<p><strong>Envelope:</strong> A charmwoven cloth envelope is necessary for use with a phlogistone furnace; this requires the skills of a charmweaver with at least 4 specialty ranks in Magicks (Weave).</p>
<p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Each hour that a phlogistone furnace is in use, it burns one pound of phlogistone per power unit supplied. The amount of power supplied can be reduced by burning lesser quantities of phlogistone.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Phlogistone Furnace:</strong> The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is required to create a phlogistone furnace, and it requires the use of clockwork gears to do so. The maximum number of clockwork gears that can be spent to create a phlogistone furnace is equal to the powderworker’s ranks in Science (Blackpowder).</p>

<h6 id="tension-trigger">Tension Trigger</h6>
<p>A tension trigger stores energy for use and then releases it. To reset a tension trigger, you need to take a reset action, which is a combined action with a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4. Unlike gear trains, tension triggers store energy for future use rather than immediate use, but unlike mainsprings a tension trigger will only store that energy for a single use.</p>

<h4 id="components">Components</h4>
<p>Components provide the basic functionality of a clockwork device, and are rated by how much space they take up inside a casing, by how much power require to run, and by the effects the component can produce.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing a Component:</strong> A component can be purchased, pre-assembled, for the cost shown on the table for that component type. The availability is equal to the highest cost die of the component.</p>
<p><strong>Constructing a Component:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, a component can be constructed by a clockworker. This requires a number of gear supplies as shown on the table for that component, and at least four hours’ work. At the end of that time, make a Science (Clockworks) roll and for each success point, the clockworker can spend 1 Creation Point’s worth of gear supplies to construct components or power sources.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> The total number of gears that a clockworker can spend on a component is limited to her number of specialty ranks in Science (Clockworks). For example, a clockworker with +3 Science (Clockworks) can only spend 3 gears on creating a movement component.</p>
<p><strong>Component Notation:</strong> A power source is described by listing the name of the power source followed by the space, power requirements, and other qualities of the component. Examples: articulation (space 1, power 0, Drop 1); carry (space 2, power 1, person); projectile weapon (space 3, power 1, weapon die d8, close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 0, long Drop 2).</p>
<h6 id="armor-1">Armor</h6>
<p>Armor plating protects both the device itself and anyone using or within the device. The armor component grants an Armor Die that can be used for Defense (Block) rolls.</p>

<h6 id="articulation">Articulation</h6>
<p>Clockwork devices are inherently clumsy; if used as replacements for a human’s natural ability, they take a Drop 4 penalty on associated actions. This is primarily the case when someone replaces part of her body with a clockwork limb, such as an arm or a leg. The articulation component reduces those penalties from Drop 4 down to Drop 2, Drop 1 or Drop 0.</p>
<p>Creating an Articulation Component: The Medicine (Surgery) specialty is required to create an articulation component with a low Drop penalty. Surgery +1 is required for Drop 1, and Surgery +2 for Drop 0.</p>

<h6 id="explosion">Explosion</h6>
<p>This component produces a loud and potentially deadly explosion. It’s used in creating bombs or grenades.</p>
<p><strong>Power Requirement:</strong> An explosion component can only be powered by a blackpowder flintlock or an alchemical capacitor. Note that blackpowder flintlocks are a lot more effective at powering an explosion than an alchemical capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> An explosion does damage to everything inside a given area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent areas, and even targets up to 2 areas away for the most powerful explosions. This environmental damage inflicts one yield for one success point, and one wound for three success points.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Destruction:</strong> Upon use, the device is destroyed by the force of its own explosion.</p>
<p><strong>Creating an Explosion Component:</strong> The Science (Blackpowder) specialty is required to create an explosion component and it requires the use of blackpowder supplies to do so. The maximum number of blackpowder supplies that can be spent to create an explosion component is equal to the powderworker’s ranks in Science (Blackpowder).</p>

<p>The item die component allows you to add an Item Die for one specialty to a device. For example, a spyglass could provide an Item Die on Observation (Perceive) rolls, or a tricked-out screwdriver could provide an Item Die on Science (Clockwork) rolls.</p>
<p>To provide a bonus to more than one specialty, add another Item Die component for each additional specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Defense (Parry), Dueling:</strong> Use the Hand-to-Hand Weapon component to add a melee Weapon Die to a device.</p>
<p><strong>Defense (Block):</strong> Use the Armor component to add an Armor Die to a device.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> These specialties can never benefit from an Item Die.</p>
<p><strong>Military (Aim):</strong> Use the Projectile Weapon component to add a ranged Weapon Die to a device.</p>

<h6 id="measurement">Measurement</h6>
<p>The measurement component allows a device to take a reading of the physical environment around it. By default, this is displayed on the device in some way. Examples of qualities that can be measured include the temperature, barometric pressure, altitude, longitude and latitude, velocity, oceanic depth, compass directions, sound levels, and more. A worn device could measure the wearer’s speed, heart rate, or blood pressure.</p>
<p>A measurement component is often tied to a calculation component to allow the device to process the information that it measures.</p>

<h6 id="powered-weapon">Powered Weapon</h6>
<p>A powered weapon is a melee weapon that has been modified with moving parts to make it even more deadly – for example, a rotating flail or a chain-toothed sword. The powered weapon component grants a bonus die that can be used whenever the device’s Weapon Die is used, including Defense (Parry) rolls and Dueling rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Size Limit:</strong> A device with the powered weapon component can be no larger than Portable size.</p>
<p><strong>Requires Hand-to-Hand Weapon:</strong> You can only add this component to a device if it already possesses the hand-to-hand weapon component. The powered weapon Bonus Die cannot exceed the Weapon Die of the device.</p>

<h6 id="projectile-weapon">Projectile Weapon</h6>
<p>A projectile weapon component fires a bullet, dart, arrow, quarrel, cannonball, or other projectile at a target. Most devices use the Military (Aim) specialty to attack, and gain a Weapon Die when doing so. As with other missile weapons in The Queen’s Cavaliers, it’s not necessary to track ammunition carried, but it is necessary to know whether or not the weapon is loaded.</p>
<p>In addition to selecting the Weapon Die, reload time, and range modifiers for the weapon, the designer also specifies which Weapon prowess is used with the weapon. Devices which require the Cannon weapon prowess use the Science (Blackpowder) specialty for attacks instead of Military (Aim).</p>
<p><strong>Magazine:</strong> A projectile weapon can optionally be fitted with a magazine component to increase the number of times it can be fired without reloading. In such a situation, the projectile weapon component loses its reload quality and uses the reload time of the magazine instead.</p>
<p><strong>Size Limit:</strong> A device with the projectile weapon component can be no larger than Carriage size. (For cannons on larger buildings or ships, just place the cannons as separate devices.)</p>
<p><strong>Ranges:</strong> The range of a projectile weapon component is determined by adding together a composite of all chosen range lines. Lines cannot be combined if they both contain a value for the same range. All ranges must be filled in with a Drop penalty or N/A.</p>
<p>The default ranges for a weapon with no extra space, cost, or power requirements are: close Drop 0, short Drop 0, medium Drop 1, long N/A.</p>

<h3 id="clothing">Clothing</h3>
<p>“Clothes make the woman,” or so the old Lutetian maxim claims. Certainly this is true in Gallinea’s capital city as well as the rest of Elara; fashion is a tangible thing in Gallinea.</p>
<p>Charmweaving, which originated in Lutetia, is the practice of adding specific dyes, trinkets, threads, and other magickal enhancements to articles of clothing. These enhancements provide bonuses to specific tasks. For more details, see charmwoven attire in Chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment.”</p>
<h4 id="clothing-qualities">Clothing Qualities</h4>
<p>Articles of clothing have the following qualities:</p>
<p><strong>Worn On:</strong> Each article of clothing is designed to be worn on a specific part of your body – head, shoulders, torso, hands, legs, or feet. In general, you can wear only one item per location, although you may be able to stack multiple cloaks on your shoulders under certain circumstances – check with your MJ to be sure.</p>
<p>Items worn on the legs can’t have charms woven into them. (See chapter 9, “Specialty Equipment.”)</p>
<p><strong>Social Rank:</strong> Some items are associated with certain social ranks. This doesn’t restrict what you can wear, regardless of your own social rank, but it may affect how you and your outfit are seen by others. The social rank of an article of clothing can be used as an availability die in a purchase roll.</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> Articles of clothing are usually handheld scale when carried, and don’t contribute to encumbrance when worn if the optional system for encumbrance is used. Items wrapped up in a box for gifting or transport are one scale category higher, including the packaging.</p>
<p>The following table lists the most common types of clothes that are found in Gallinea. Detailed descriptions of each type of clothing are given in Chapter 9.</p>

<p><strong>Clockworker outfit (Artisan 1D8):</strong> This is worn while doing mechanician work, and usually has a lot of extraneous pockets and loops for tools and gears. The most notable feature is the set of gearspring goggles, which give an item die bonus of Perceive +1D6 on visual checks.</p>
<p><strong>Corsair outfit (Soldier 1D6):</strong> Worn by sailors and pirates around the world, and by many would-be buccaneers, this outfit certainly captures the look of the chic privateer.</p>
<p><strong>Courtly outfit (Noble 1D10):</strong> Nobles, and those who must interact with them, are known for their outlandishly ornate couture and finely arranged coiffure.</p>
<p><strong>Crafter outfit (Artisan 1D8):</strong> Similar to a clockworker outfit, a crafter outfit is for doing productive work, be it artistic, magickal, or smithing in content.</p>
<p><strong>Military outfit (Soldier 1D6):</strong> Military outfits come with an appropriate tabard from the correct military unit, noble house, mercenary group, or city guard. For example, a veteran/constable may have one tabard from the Gallinean army, and another from the Lutetia watch. Military outfits don’t come with a torso item, to facilitate the wearing of armor.</p>
<p><strong>Peasant outfit (Commoner 1D0):</strong> Plain and practical, peasant outfits can be found throughout Gallinea, and in nearly every social rank. As they’re easily patched, many peasant outfits are simply stitched together from different types and colors of fabric. Lately, the upper social ranks have tried to adopt this patchwork style, albeit with little success.</p>
<p><strong>Physician outfit (Artisan 1D8):</strong> The notable feature of this outfit is the large, vaguely bird-shaped mask used during surgery; the beak of this mask contains herbs and cloth meant to filter out diseases. Most physician outfits start out white in color, but quickly become stained with crimson.</p>
<p><strong>Priest outfit (Artisan 1D8):</strong> The traditional dress of Asrian clergy varies by their rank within the church. Lower-ranking chaplains wear outfits of brighter, primary colors while those higher in the hierarchy are allowed additional colors that are darker and more complex.</p>
<p><strong>Scholar’s outfit (Artisan 1D8):</strong> Students and instructors at universities, seminaries, officer schools, and other institutions of higher learning are expected to dress in traditional scholarly robes while teaching or attending classes. Outside of class, of course, they’re free to wear whatever they want.</p>
<p><strong>Swashbuckler outfit (Soldier 1D6):</strong> The cavalier hat, the billowing cape, the high boots – anyone wearing this outfit cuts a dashing figure indeed. While some such outfits are more sedate and refined, many look as if the wearer stepped out of the latest Alais Neversette novella.</p>

<h4 id="the-nine-laws-of-fashion">The Nine Laws of Fashion</h4>
<p>Charmwoven clothes are useful, stylish, and expensive, but they are also made according to exacting standards known as Gallinea’s Nine Laws of Fashion. Flouting these laws could lead to your Charms simply failing to work at all!</p>
<p>While these are known as “Gallinea’s” Laws, that’s not because they’re enforced by the Queen’s decree or by some sort of “fashion police” that stalks the streets of Lutetia. Instead, these are akin to natural Laws that were first noticed and codified in Gallinea; they simply describe how things are rather than how they should be.</p>
<p>The First is the simplest Law:</p>
<h5 id="the-first-law-the-law-of-couture">The First Law: The Law of Couture</h5>
<p><em>“One’s clothes must fit properly.”</em></p>
<p>It seems obvious at first – clothing is meant to be worn and to fit properly! But it’s also the most important. If your clothes aren’t sized correctly for you, none of the charms will function. In addition, each off-size article of clothing you wear adds a Drop 1 penalty to combat actions if it’s too large or too small.</p>
<p>To ensure your clothes are properly sized, you can’t just buy your clothes off the rack; the people of Gallinea are a diverse group when it comes to body size, and there are no “standard sizes”. Your clothes will need to be either be created specifically for you, or altered by a tailor. Only then can charms be effectively added to such apparel.</p>
<h5 id="the-second-law-the-law-of-attunement">The Second Law: The Law of Attunement</h5>
<p><em>“Charms are unique to the wearer.”</em></p>
<p>You can’t just pick up any random charmwoven item and put it on, even if it fits you. The patterns, glyphs, and trinkets sewn into charmwoven clothing have to be calibrated for each wearers. This is a pretty simple process – as long as the charmweaver knows your birth date, birth time, and place of birth. It usually takes about an hour to attune or reattune charms to any given person.</p>
<p>What if you don’t know some or any of that information to tell your charmweaver? There are two options.</p>
<p>First, your charmweaver can attempt to adjust the charms to you anyway, through trial and error. This takes one hour per piece of information about your birth that you’re missing. At the end of that process, the charmweaver makes a simple Magicks (Weave) roll with the opposition pool based on how much they don’t know, as shown on the following table.</p>
<h6 id="opposition-pool-for-charm-attunement-rolls">Opposition Pool for Charm Attunement Rolls</h6>

<p>The dice pool is based on all of these factors – so if you know the exact date of your birth, that you know you were born in the morning, and that you were born somewhere in Talania, that’s an opposition pool of 1D0+1D8+1D8, or 2D8. As it’s a simple check, the charmweaver needs just one success point to correctly attune the item. On a failed check, the charmweaver needs to start over again to attune the item.</p>
<p>The second option involves the use of Magicks (Portents), and for this reason many charmweavers either work with those who can read omens, or can do so themselves.</p>
<p>The opposition pool for the Portents roll is the same as the pool calculated above for the trial-and-error method using the Magicks (Weave) specialty, but this is a standard roll not a simple roll. It takes one minute to perform this type of reading, the portent-reader must see you the entire time, and you must be willing to have it done. Each success point spent reveals either your birth date, your birth time to the minute, or your city or village of birth.</p>
<h5 id="the-third-law-the-law-of-pertinence">The Third Law: The Law of Pertinence</h5>
<p><em>“The charm must correspond to the article.”</em></p>
<p>Simply stated, this means that a charm can only be applied to an item that has some relationship to the type of enchantment desired.</p>
<p>For example, gloves for soldiers can be given charms that assist with Dueling or Military (Aim), while gloves for craftsmen can be charmed for Magicks, Medicine, or Science.</p>
<p>Pertinent skills for any given type of clothing are found later in this chapter, in the “Articles of Clothing” section. The “Creating Charmwoven Clothing” section, also found in this chapter, summarizes which types of charms can be applied to which pieces of attire.</p>

<p><strong>Beret, Artisan’s:</strong> The simple woolen beret is common among crafters in Gallinea. You can get a beret in many different colors, although beret colors have extra significance within Lutetian society. Each craft guild claims ownership of a particular, exacting shade of blue, green, or red, and will object strenuously to anyone unaffiliated wearing “their” colors. To those outside of the Lutetian guilds, the distinctions between beret colors is almost entirely opaque.</p>
<p><strong>Capotain:</strong> A capotain is a tall hat, usually flat on the top, with a narrow brim. It originated in Albia and has since spread to Gallinea, usually worn by the soldiery. Most capotains are black in color, and many sport buckles in front – although Albian purists claim that such a frivolity is inauthentic and typical of Gallinea’s love of decoration for its own sake.</p>
<p><strong>Cavalier Hat:</strong> Made famous by the Queen’s cavaliers but worn throughout Gallinea, cavalier hats have a wide brim and are usually worn with one side pinned up. A dyed ostrich feather is often added, both for appearance’s sake and to allow all-black hats to take a charm. Sometimes these hats are colloquially referred to as neversettes.</p>
<p><strong>Goggles, Gearspring:</strong> These goggles are created and used by mechanicians as well as other crafters. Each set of goggles has two or more pairs of lenses that can be swapped in as necessary – functions include magnification of small objects, telescopic sighting of distant objects, filters for specific colors, or simple eye protection. Gearspring goggles offer a +1D6 Item Die on Observation (Perception) rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Ribbons:</strong> Magickally charmed hair ribbons are popular with the upper classes and are woven into the hairstyles – or wigs – of any gender of noble. Unless affixed to a wig (which must be one of the neutral colors of argent, brunâtre, cendree, or sable), the ribbons require anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to weave into hair, or double that time if forced to don them without the help of a capable household servant.</p>
<p><strong>Masque:</strong> Not a bandanna clumsily worn by a common brigand to disguise her identity, a masque actually does little to hide one’s appearance. Used by the nobility at their lavish parties, each is custom created to reflect the wearer’s persona and opinions of herself. Many masques only encircle the eyes and the space between them, while others cover the entire face. A Gallinean holiday called the Festival of Masques celebrates freedoms, including sexual freedoms, and is a time when nobles and non-nobles alike don masques to participate in the revelry.</p>
<p><strong>Plague Mask:</strong> Part of a chirurgeon’s standard surgical wear, a plague mask is usually styled like a bird’s long beak, although other examples exist, such as long tusks or simply a cylinder. Goggles built into the mask provide covering for the chirurgeon’s eyes, while medicinal herbs and complex filters in the “nose” cavity prevent infection of air-carried diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Skullcap, Clerical:</strong> Sometimes called calottes, these skullcaps are associated with the Asrian religion and worn by its chaplains. Lower-ranking priests of Eserre wear celeste, azure, vert, or brunâtre skullcaps, while those higher in the order cover their skulls with calottes of argent, carnation, or purpure. Only those clergy appointed as Guardians of the Faith are allowed to wear Or skullcaps, with the golden yellow color symbolizing their connection to the sun goddess. Lay workers within the church are free to wear sable or cendree calottes while performing church duties.</p>
<p><strong>Tricorne:</strong> These felt hats have wide brims like cavalier hats, but are pinned up on the sides and backs, forming them into triangular shapes. In Gallinea and Albia it’s traditional to wear the tricorne with the single point facing forward, and in Ekalia and Dragosa to wear it pointing back. Tricornes are most popular among sailors and members of the military, with officers using them to display medals and other symbols of rank.</p>

<p>Shoulder charms tend to be about skills that are flashy and attention-getting, although a few have use in disguising or hiding the wearer.</p>

<h3 id="living-expenses">Living Expenses</h3>
<p>Characters in <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> are assumed to have their housing and daily nutritional needs met by their Social Rank scores without having to make Wealth rolls or spend Rewards for normal daily living. Only unusual expenses, such as a night on the town or an inn stay in a distant city, need to be paid for separately.</p>
<p>The costs below are fairly standardized across Gallinea, although it’s only the larger towns and cities that have the best food, inns, and alcohol. As a package, one night’s stay for a character and her horse in an inn with an attached tavern will cost 4D0 for the cheapest room and food, 3D6+1D0 for good quality, and 3D8+1D0 for the most exquisite food, drink, and suite.</p>
<p>Characters who go carousing and buy rounds on the house can use the price of the most expensive alcohol bought as an Item die on their Streetwise (Carouse) rolls.</p>

<h3 id="gallinean-holidays">Gallinean Holidays</h3>
<h5 id="asrian-holy-days">Asrian Holy Days</h5>
<p>The sixth day of every month is the first Sun Day of that month, and is when most Asrian holy days celebrate the sun goddess Eserre. Devout Gallineans are expected to attend church on those days, even if they don’t manage to make it to services on any other Sun Day in a month.</p>
<p>6 Nivôse is celebrated as Winter’s Dawn, and is considered the official start of the winter season. Services in the Asrian churches ask for the blessings of the Goddess-Empress Eserre upon the faithful, and ask for a gentle winter.</p>
<p>The winter solstice occurs on 6 Pluviôse, marking the midpoint of winter and the time in which Eserre’s sun is out for the least amount of time. Gallineans mark this date, and the two days around it, with the Winter’s Noon Festival – a time to come together and share warmth, food, and stories, in addition to religious services.</p>
<p>The 6th of Ventôse is the third holy day of winter in the Asrian faith, and is known as Winter’s Dusk. Heading out of the coldest part of the year toward the spring thaw, the Chaplains of Eserre ask for a prosperous growing season. Tradition says that if a sun jay sees its shadow at noon on Winter’s Dusk, winter weather will continue into Germinal, the next month. The Chaplains in Lutetia raise sun jays specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Spring’s Dawn, on 6 Germinal, is a day of thanks for the end of winter and start of spring, with churches and worshipers alike decorated with flowers. The 6th of Floréal is Spring’s Noon, the vernal equinox, and is marked by outdoor festivals and dances around spring poles. Spring’s Dusk on 6 Prairial is holy day of peace, when even the most brutal of Elara’s armies will refrain from war.</p>
<p>Confirmation Day, 18 Prairial, commemorates the mythological wedding of Eserre to her beloved Safira, the first Bride of the Sun. On this day each year, young teenagers publicly present themselves as faithful followers of the Sun Goddess and are henceforth considered as adults by the Church.</p>
<p>On 6 Messidor, Summer’s Dawn, the Asrian high holy months officially begin, lasting until Summer’s Dusk, 6 Fructidor. The legends of Eserre and the Qartan Empire are read or re-enacted over the course of eight consecutive Sun Days, save for 6 Fervidor, the holiest day of the year. On that longest day of the year, and the days before and after it, known as Summer’s Noon, the most lavish celebrations are held under the midday sun. The most non-pious Gallineans will make a point to attend these midsummer services, even if they will never enter a church or cathedral the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The fall holy days of Autumn’s Dawn (6 Vendémiaire), Autumn’s Noon (6 Brumaire), and Autumn’s Dusk (6 Frimaire) are quieter affairs, devoted to teaching, sermons, and service as the year winds down, the crops are harvested, and the worshipers of the Sun Goddess prepare for winter.</p>
<h5 id="new-moon-festivals">New Moon Festivals</h5>
<p>In addition to Asrian religious holy days, Gallineans also celebrate ancient traditions associated with the Old Faith of the witches. These folk holidays occur on new moons, in the evening when the sky is dark. Most involve sharing of gifts and meals with family and close friends.</p>
<p>The New Hunger Moon, 16 Nivôse, is a time for giving food to those in need in the chill of winter. 16 Pluviôse, the New Wolf Moon, is marked by the exchange of furs and warm clothing. New Snow Moon, on 16 Ventôse, is a celebration marked by wine and other types of alcohol that have been saved in the snow all winter.</p>
<p>The New Sap Moon, on 16 Germinal, celebrates the start of spring with traditional meals of maple syrups served on crêpes. 16 Floréal is the New Rain Moon, and gifts of boots and jackets are common as the spring rains begin. On 16 Prairial, the New Wishing Moon is celebrated with exchanges of lucky trinkets and wishes kept in secret.</p>
<p>The 16th of Messidor, the New Berry Moon, marks the beginning of summer with sweet pies, tarts, and pastries. The New Kissing Moon, on 16 Fervidor, is a night for lovers to spend in each others’ arms under the stars, and is said to be the reason that there are more births than normal in Floréal nine months later. The final folk celebration of the summer, New Peddler’s Moon, is celebrated through the exchange of hand-made gifts given as part of a mock barter system.</p>
<p>The first of the fall festivals, the New Harvest Moon on 16 Vendémiaire, is a night of bonfires, music, and dancing. The New Huntress Moon, 16 Brumaire, is marked by large dinners of game meats such as venison, rabbit, or pheasant. On the night of 16 Frimaire, the New Mourning Moon, Gallineans remember their dead friends and relatives, especially those who have passed within the last year, through guising or mumming.</p>
<h5 id="devran-holy-days">Devran Holy Days</h5>
<p>The Devrans have their own holy days when the moon is a crescent in the sky. The 13th of each month is known as Last Crescent, and the 19th of each month is the First Crescent. Ceremonies are held on both nights, and many Devrans fast nightly during the week between the two holy days.</p>
<h5 id="national-holidays">National Holidays</h5>
<p>Gallinea’s national holidays are secular in nature and recognize important events in the history of the queendom.</p>
<p>Treaty Day, also known as Betrothal Day, is the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Scanbreille on 21 Nivôse 1241 – ending the war between Albia and Gallinea through the later marriage of Prince Carolus to Princess Mariana, the future Queen Mariana II. The 16th day of Floréal, also called Espousal Day, is the anniversary of the wedding of Carolus and Mariana in 1242.</p>
<p>Scanbrian Unification Day, 15 Pluviôse, commemorates the date in 989 when Scanbria became unified with Gallinea. Scanbrians also celebrate 30 Fructidor, Scanbrian Independence Day, which marks the date in 986 when Scanbria declared its independence from Varendia. Many older Scanbrian families still resent that the Grand Duchy of Scanbria lasted for only three years before being annexed by the Gallineans, and the day is usually one for political agitation. Needless to say, Scanbrian Independence Day is not celebrated in the rest of Gallinea.</p>
<p>Victory Day, on 7 Prairial, marks the defeat of Varendia in 1123 by future princess-consort Clarisse Sudelune, also known as La Dame de la Victoire. The day is celebrated by military parades along the Rue du Couer, both in Lutetia and elsewhere in Gallinea.</p>
<p>The Festival of Masques is held on 24 Prairial every year, and is an annual celebration of freedom in Lutetia centered around lavish masquerade balls, street parties, and excessive drinking. Anyone caught outside of their home without a disguise is “arrested” and taken to the nearest constable, who forces them to wear a cheap and embarrassing costume. The Festival of Masques is also a time for much intrigue and illicit affairs, as no one is whom they seem to be.</p>
<p>One of the largest civic holidays is the birthday of the queen. As the current queen, Mariana’s birth is celebrated every 19 Fructidor. The birthday of her mother, the late Queen Elisse II, used to be celebrated on 21 Floréal but is no longer an official holiday. Some members of the nobility, who strongly opposed Elisse’s policies when she lived, celebrate only her birthday to insult the current queen.</p>
<p>The deaths of Queen Elisse and her daughter, crown princess Jehanne, are remembered by solemn ceremonies on 22 Frimaire, as they have been every year since that dark day in 1243.</p>
<p>30 Nivôse and 1 Pluviôse, the end of one year and the start of the next, are secular holidays celebrated as Year’s Dusk and Year’s Dawn. These are usually quiet days of reflection on the events of the previous twelve months and a time to make plans for the upcoming year.</p>
<h4 id="gender-sexuality-and-race">Gender, Sexuality, and Race</h4>
<p>In general, Gallinea is a diverse nation, full of people of all genders, sexualities, and races. While that mostly holds true upon closer examination, the Land of the Ascendant Pegasus does still retain some inequalities based on old traditions and biases.</p>
<h5 id="gender">Gender</h5>
<p>Gallinean custom has long held the primacy of women within society – after all, the traditionalists argue, it is women who maintain the stability of culture. The identity of one’s other parent may be in doubt, but there’s never a question about who gave birth to a child. Thus, inheritance passes along matrilineal lines and thus concentrating wealth and societal power among women.</p>
<p>This rule still holds true for most nobles – and continues to be an expectation of the Royalty – but has lost popularity among those in the lower social classes.</p>
<p>Queen Delphine, great-grandmother of current queen Mariana, decreed in 1172 PQ that inheritance within Gallinea would pass to the oldest child regardless of gender – and as much as this pleased the commoners, it enraged the nobility to the same extent. Two years later, in 1174 PQ, she rescinded that decree and replaced it with a rule that each family could designate either the oldest daughter or oldest son as inheritor. Most nobles stuck to the old ways, however, and named daughters as heirs.</p>
<p>Delphine’s granddaughter, Queen Elisse III, expanded the decree in 1240 to allow any child to be named as an heir, regardless of birth order or gender, as part of her Elissian Reforms. After Elisse’s assassination, her husband (as prince-regent) and her daughter Queen Mariana maintained the Reforms enacted by Elisse before her death, but haven’t yet enacted the further reforms desired by the late queen.</p>
<p>Besides inheritance, other forms of gender discrimination have likewise been banned since Delphine’s reign, but most positions of authority and responsibility within Gallinean higher society are still held by women.</p>
<p>Traditional Asrian theology holds that the First Prohibition, “Let no man be superior to a woman,” defines a role for a woman as the head of a family, head of a country, and head of a business, but modern interpretations over the last millennium have taken this to be a call for gender-neutrality and lack of gender-based oppression.</p>
<p>The Asrian Church has thus become a bastion of gender equality, although with persistent trappings of matriarchy – Eserre is viewed as a sun goddess as opposed to a gender-neutral deity, for example. The Church is headed by the Bride of the Sun and her Handmaidens, which are ceremonial positions that are treated as female for liturgical purposes, regardless of the gender of the occupant of the office.</p>
<p>Within Gallinean politics, the Church takes a middle line between the beliefs of the Monarchy and the nobility, not quite willing to fully endorse the Elissian Reforms but nonetheless prompting for greater equality of gender within Asrian culture.</p>
<p>With the increased acceptance of gender equality has also come greater acceptance of those who don’t fall into a binary gender assigned to them at birth. Gender roles have become understood as a question of self-identification, including people who exist outside of a strict binary as well as those who are comfortable within it.</p>
<p>Female and male identities are considered legitimate regardless of birth assignment. Legal recognition of gender is not required for all but those in the higher tiers of society, and the procedure itself is a relatively simple procedure before a or a royal bailiff or a provincial prévôt. Petitioners receive a decree in the name of the queen or the nobility of the province, recognizing their gender for all purposes.</p>
<p>The Elissian Decrees went further than that, and legally recognized all variations of gender identity – from those without gender at all to those who combine either binary gender in ways unique to that individual. This codified a long-standing practice among the lower and middle classes of affirming the genders of everyone, not just those within a strict binary.</p>
<p>The Gallinean language is a relatively genderless tongue that does not require that a grammatical gender be assigned to every noun, verb, or pronoun. However, as with most Qartan-descended languages, many traditional names for occupations, noble titles, place of origin, and so on, are expressed in female terminology. Older Gallineans consider these terms to be gender-neutral by default, but younger speakers of the language are moving toward more inclusive speech.</p>
<p>“She” is the default pronoun for a person of unspecified gender within classical Gallinean, but there has been some progress made toward using “they” as gender-neutral as well. “Iel/iem/ier/iels/ielself”, a set of non-binary pronouns used in some classical writings, has made a recent resurgence and is used within the texts of the Elissian Reforms.</p>
<p>While physiological alterations are never required of those asserting their gender within Gallinean society – for legal or for social purposes – many such individuals desire changes to their bodies to better match their self-image. Long-known alchemical formulations can provide the equivalent of hormone replacement to those who wish it, and a number of medical procedures exist that can provide further changes to bring one’s body into conformance with their stated gender.</p>
<h6 id="sidebar-gender-terminology">(Sidebar) Gender Terminology</h6>

<p>Female. An adjective describing someone who is a woman.</p>
<p>Male. An adjective describing someone who is a man.</p>

<p>Perybrean. An adjective describing someone whose gender is a combination of male and female, with that combination either being fixed or fluid over time. Named after the Ekalian twin deities Peryon and Sybrea who are to be reflections of each other or possibly the same god.</p>
<p>Woman. Someone who is female.</p>
<h5 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h5>
<p>The concept of “homosexuality” and “heterosexuality” as distinct sexual orientations is unknown within Gallinean society. Society, overall, is bisexual and one’s preference for specific genders is considered a personal matter. No one cares whether this is an inborn preference or a matter of choice; you love who you love, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p>The second Profession of Asrianism states that love is a gift from Eserre herself, and the Books of the Sun encourage all to love as freely as you wish, love as deeply as you wish, and love whomever you wish. Eserre herself is depicted as married to a woman, the first Bride of the Sun, and thus all subsequent leaders of the Asrian church have been considered liturgically female.</p>
<p>Marriage or partnership within Gallinean culture can be between a woman and a man, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, and recently, between any one person and another regardless of gender or lack thereof. Monogamy is expected among Asrian Gallineans, although monoamory is a matter left up to the people in the relationship. Thus, you can only be married to one person, but it a mutual decision between the two of you whether it is an open relationship or a closed one.</p>
<p>The term “marriage” is reserved for those couples united in a religious ceremony; otherwise it is called a “partnership”. Terms such as “wife”, “husband”, “spouse”, or “partner”, are not restricted to one type of union; as with many other decisions this is made by each couple as they choose. Gallineans consider all terms to refer to the same concept, although classical Gallinean traditionally calls male spouses “husbands” and female spouses “wives.”</p>
<p>In recent years, greater acceptance has been made of those who are not sexually attracted at all. Previously, asexual people were thought of as being eccentric, of being damaged in some way, or as just not having found the right person yet. One decree in the Elissian Reforms establishes full legal equality, including inheritance rights, to people who are asexual.</p>
<h6 id="sidebar-sexuality-terminology">(Sidebar) Sexuality Terminology</h6>
<p>Jathyc. An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two men, named after the Ekalian deity Jathys, god of craftsmanship and commerce.</p>
<p>Outré. An archaic adjective describing a man who is exclusively attracted to women, or a woman who is exclusively attracted to men. Often considered offensive.</p>
<p>Reian (adj). A recently-coined adjective describing someone who does not feel sexual attraction, or sometimes, romantic attraction. Named after the Ekalian deity Reios, god of politics and the underworld.</p>
<p>Reian (n). Someone whose sexuality is reian.</p>
<p>Sapphique. An adjective describing a sexual or romantic relationship between two women, named after Safira, the first Bride of the Sun according to Asrian theology.</p>
<p>There are no particular terms for being a bisexual person, a lesbian, or a gay man in Gallinean. Such concepts don’t exist in Elaran cultures.</p>

<h3 id="gallinean-holidays-1">Gallinean Holidays</h3>
<h4 id="asrian-holy-days-1">Asrian Holy Days</h4>
<p>The sixth day of every month is the first Sun Day of that month, and is when most Asrian holy days celebrate the sun goddess Eserre. Devout Gallineans are expected to attend church on those days, even if they don’t manage to make it to services on any other Sun Day in a month.</p>
<p>6 Nivôse is celebrated as Winter’s Dawn, and is considered the official start of the winter season. Services in the Asrian churches ask for the blessings of the Goddess-Empress Eserre upon the faithful, and ask for a gentle winter.</p>
<p>The winter solstice occurs on 6 Pluviôse, marking the midpoint of winter and the time in which Eserre’s sun is out for the least amount of time. Gallineans mark this date, and the two days around it, with the Winter’s Noon Festival – a time to come together and share warmth, food, and stories, in addition to religious services.</p>
<p>The 6th of Ventôse is the third holy day of winter in the Asrian faith, and is known as Winter’s Dusk. Heading out of the coldest part of the year toward the spring thaw, the Chaplains of Eserre ask for a prosperous growing season. Tradition says that if a sun jay sees its shadow at noon on Winter’s Dusk, winter weather will continue into Germinal, the next month. The Chaplains in Lutetia raise sun jays specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Spring’s Dawn, on 6 Germinal, is a day of thanks for the end of winter and start of spring, with churches and worshipers alike decorated with flowers. The 6th of Floréal is Spring’s Noon, the vernal equinox, and is marked by outdoor festivals and dances around spring poles. Spring’s Dusk on 6 Prairial is holy day of peace, when even the most brutal of Elara’s armies will refrain from war.</p>
<p>Confirmation Day, 18 Prairial, commemorates the mythological wedding of Eserre to her beloved Safira, the first Bride of the Sun. On this day each year, young teenagers publicly present themselves as faithful followers of the Sun Goddess and are henceforth considered as adults by the Church.</p>
<p>On 6 Messidor, Summer’s Dawn, the Asrian high holy months officially begin, lasting until Summer’s Dusk, 6 Fructidor. The legends of Eserre and the Qartan Empire are read or re-enacted over the course of eight consecutive Sun Days, save for 6 Fervidor, the holiest day of the year. On that longest day of the year, and the days before and after it, known as Summer’s Noon, the most lavish celebrations are held under the midday sun. The most non-pious Gallineans will make a point to attend these midsummer services, even if they will never enter a church or cathedral the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The fall holy days of Autumn’s Dawn (6 Vendémiaire), Autumn’s Noon (6 Brumaire), and Autumn’s Dusk (6 Frimaire) are quieter affairs, devoted to teaching, sermons, and service as the year winds down, the crops are harvested, and the worshipers of the Sun Goddess prepare for winter.</p>
<h4 id="new-moon-festivals-1">New Moon Festivals</h4>
<p>In addition to Asrian religious holy days, Gallineans also celebrate ancient traditions associated with the Old Faith of the witches. These folk holidays occur on new moons, in the evening when the sky is dark. Most involve sharing of gifts and meals with family and close friends.</p>
<p>The New Hunger Moon, 16 Nivôse, is a time for giving food to those in need in the chill of winter. 16 Pluviôse, the New Wolf Moon, is marked by the exchange of furs and warm clothing. New Snow Moon, on 16 Ventôse, is a celebration marked by wine and other types of alcohol that have been saved in the snow all winter.</p>
<p>The New Sap Moon, on 16 Germinal, celebrates the start of spring with traditional meals of maple syrups served on crêpes. 16 Floréal is the New Rain Moon, and gifts of boots and jackets are common as the spring rains begin. On 16 Prairial, the New Wishing Moon is celebrated with exchanges of lucky trinkets and wishes kept in secret.</p>
<p>The 16th of Messidor, the New Berry Moon, marks the beginning of summer with sweet pies, tarts, and pastries. The New Kissing Moon, on 16 Fervidor, is a night for lovers to spend in each others’ arms under the stars, and is said to be the reason that there are more births than normal in Floréal nine months later. The final folk celebration of the summer, New Peddler’s Moon, is celebrated through the exchange of hand-made gifts given as part of a mock barter system.</p>
<p>The first of the fall festivals, the New Harvest Moon on 16 Vendémiaire, is a night of bonfires, music, and dancing. The New Huntress Moon, 16 Brumaire, is marked by large dinners of game meats such as venison, rabbit, or pheasant. On the night of 16 Frimaire, the New Mourning Moon, Gallineans remember their dead friends and relatives, especially those who have passed within the last year, through guising or mumming.</p>
<h4 id="devran-holy-days-1">Devran Holy Days</h4>
<p>The Devrans have their own holy days when the moon is a crescent in the sky. The 13th of each month is known as Last Crescent, and the 19th of each month is the First Crescent. Ceremonies are held on both nights, and many Devrans fast nightly during the week between the two holy days.</p>
<h4 id="national-holidays-1">National Holidays</h4>
<p>Gallinea’s national holidays are secular in nature and recognize important events in the history of the queendom.</p>
<p>Treaty Day, also known as Betrothal Day, is the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Scanbreille on 21 Nivôse 1241 – ending the war between Albia and Gallinea through the later marriage of Prince Carolus to Princess Mariana, the future Queen Mariana II. The 16th day of Floréal, also called Espousal Day, is the anniversary of the wedding of Carolus and Mariana in 1242.</p>
<p>Scanbrian Unification Day, 15 Pluviôse, commemorates the date in 989 when Scanbria became unified with Gallinea. Scanbrians also celebrate 30 Fructidor, Scanbrian Independence Day, which marks the date in 986 when Scanbria declared its independence from Varendia. Many older Scanbrian families still resent that the Grand Duchy of Scanbria lasted for only three years before being annexed by the Gallineans, and the day is usually one for political agitation. Needless to say, Scanbrian Independence Day is not celebrated in the rest of Gallinea.</p>
<p>Victory Day, on 7 Prairial, marks the defeat of Varendia in 1123 by future princess-consort Clarisse Sudelune, also known as La Dame de la Victoire. The day is celebrated by military parades along the Rue du Couer, both in Lutetia and elsewhere in Gallinea.</p>
<p>The Festival of Masques is held on 24 Prairial every year, and is an annual celebration of freedom in Lutetia centered around lavish masquerade balls, street parties, and excessive drinking. Anyone caught outside of their home without a disguise is “arrested” and taken to the nearest constable, who forces them to wear a cheap and embarrassing costume. The Festival of Masques is also a time for much intrigue and illicit affairs, as no one is whom they seem to be.</p>
<p>One of the largest civic holidays is the birthday of the queen. As the current queen, Mariana’s birth is celebrated every 19 Fructidor. The birthday of her mother, the late Queen Elisse II, used to be celebrated on 21 Floréal but is no longer an official holiday. Some members of the nobility, who strongly opposed Elisse’s policies when she lived, celebrate only her birthday to insult the current queen.</p>
<p>The deaths of Queen Elisse and her daughter, crown princess Jehanne, are remembered by solemn ceremonies on 22 Frimaire, as they have been every year since that dark day in 1243.</p>
<p>30 Nivôse and 1 Pluviôse, the end of one year and the start of the next, are secular holidays celebrated as Year’s Dusk and Year’s Dawn. These are usually quiet days of reflection on the events of the previous twelve months and a time to make plans for the upcoming year.</p>
<h2 id="opponents">Opponents</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-opponents">Types of Opponents</h3>
<p>There are several types of opponents that can present challenges, both in combat and out of combat, for player characters. These opponents are rated in terms of how important they are to the story: rabble are at best extras, while minor opponents take supporting roles. Major opponents, of course, can challenge a group of cavaliers as major villains or powerful allies!</p>
<h6 id="using-opponents">Using Opponents</h6>
<p>Don’t assume that all opponents are there to fight! A corrupt noble, scheming artisan, angry soldier, or even hapless rabble could complicate the heroes’ lives without even lifting a finger.</p>
<p>Use opposed rolls, such as a duplicitous politician’s Deception vs. a player’s Negotation, to represent a duel of words – trying to to convince a court of one’s guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>Don’t make rolls against Standard Opposition for opponents, though – you shouldn’t ever be rolling against yourself! Either find a way for the player to oppose the roll, or just decide via fiat whether the opponent succeeds or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an opponent is actually friendly and wishes to help the cavaliers, use the rule for assisting to have them grant additional dice to the players’ rolls.</p>
<h4 id="rabble">Rabble</h4>
<p>Usually appearing in groups, rabble are faceless opposition who don’t present a major challenge to the player characters. Rabble have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>D0 or D6 Competency die</li>
<li>Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die</li>
<li>Yield Limit of 3</li>
<li>Wound Limit of 1 (after taking 1 wound, they are Dying)</li>
<li>Attributes of D6/D6/D6, D8/D8/D8, or D6/D8/D10</li>
<li>Maximum of +1 Specialty Ranks</li>
<li>Two Passions (D8, D6)</li>
<li>No Style Maneuvers</li>
<li>Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point</li>
<li>Usually appear in groups (up to twice the number of PCs)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stock-character">Stock Character</h4>
<p>A stock character is one that has a tangible role in the game but probably doesn’t need a name; instead, they are identified by their profession or story role. Characteristics of stock characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competency die usually D6 (D8 or higher for elite characters)</li>
<li>Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die plus Competency die</li>
<li>Yield Limit equal to 3 plus half the maximum value of their Competency die</li>
<li>Wound Limit of 2 (Drop 1, Dying)</li>
<li>Attributes of D8/D8/D8 or D6/D8/D10</li>
<li>Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties (or higher for elite characters)</li>
<li>Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)</li>
<li>One or Two Style Maneuvers</li>
<li>Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point</li>
<li>Sometimes appear in groups (one per PC), or sometimes lead groups of rabble</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="minor-character">Minor Character</h4>
<p>A minor character usually has a name, and has more of a background (and usually more skills) than a stock character or rabble. Minor characters have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competency die usually D6 or D8 (D10 or higher for elite characters)</li>
<li>Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die</li>
<li>Yield Limit equal to 3 plus the maximum value of their Competency die</li>
<li>Wound Limit of 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)</li>
<li>Attributes of D6/D8/D10</li>
<li>Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties</li>
<li>Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)</li>
<li>Two Style Maneuvers</li>
<li>Start with 1 Style Point, with a maximum of 3 Style Points</li>
<li>Usually appear singly although often found in groups of minor characters or stock characters as leaders, or as henchpersons of major characters</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="major-character">Major Character</h4>
<p>Major characters always have names, and play a key role as opponents (or allies) for the player characters. All should have complex motivations and are built as player characters are built, with just a few exceptions. Characteristics of major characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competency die of D8 or higher, and corresponding experience points spent</li>
<li>Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die</li>
<li>Yield limit equal to 6 plus the maximum value of their Competency die</li>
<li>Wound limit of 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)</li>
<li>Attributes of D6/D8/D10</li>
<li>Maximum of +3 Specialty Ranks (higher for elite characters); built as per player characters with experience points</li>
<li>Four Passions (D12, D10, D8, D6)</li>
<li>Three Style Maneuvers, plus additional if bought with experience points</li>
<li>Start with 3 Style Points, with a maximum of 6 Style Points</li>
<li>Are unique individuals in the world</li>
<li>Have full character sheets as do player characters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customizing-opponents">Customizing Opponents</h3>
<p>You can adjust opponents to represent other types of characters in the world; for example, a Pirate Crewmember could be used as the basis for an Ekalian Navy Sailor by changing her Passions.</p>
<p>Some of the ways you can customize the opponents listed in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the size of the Competency die (from D6 to D8, for example)</li>
<li>Adding or removing specialty ranks (up to the maximum value)</li>
<li>Changing equipment</li>
<li>Upping the Yield Limit or Wound Limit</li>
<li>Altering the character’s Passions</li>
<li>Adding, removing, or changing a Style Maneuver</li>
<li>Adding, removing, or changing a Language</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rabble-1">Rabble</h3>
<p>The following characters could be used as opponents for typical starting cavaliers (D6 or D8 Competency dice), or can be used as allies, rivals, assistants, or supporting characters.</p>
<h4 id="angry-mob-member">Angry Mob Member</h4>
<p><em>Rabble</em></p>
<p>From time to time, even the tolerant and accepting people of Gallinea can get roused into an angry horde looking for blood, especially if the right balance of rhetoric and wine is maintained. These rabble can represent any mob that gathers for some specific purpose.</p>

<p><em>Rabble</em></p>
<p>Charity food, housing, and education are all available to the poor in Gallinea, but not all choose to partake of such hospitality for reasons of their own.

<p><em>Rabble</em></p>

<h4 id="creating-major-characters">Creating Major Characters</h4>
<p>As key opponents in a game of <em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em>, major characters should be created to serve specific roles in your game, such as a master villain, a major foil, a powerful ally, or a respected mentor. The recommended method is to build a major opponent in the same way that you’d create a player character, choosing two classes and so on, and then adding extra experience.</p>
<p>But sometimes you don’t have the time to do it that way, and you just need to create one simply. Here’s how that works.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, come up with an idea of what this character is like, and what kind of role she’ll play in the campaign.</li>
<li>Pick five specialties which she’ll use the most; perhaps Lunge for a duelist or Inspire for a chaplain. These are her primary specialties.</li>
<li>Choose another five specialties which are important, but not the focus of her activity. These are secondary specialties.</li>
<li>Finally, pick another five tertiary specialties, which are things she can do, but aren’t central to her character.</li>
<li>Assign a D10, D8, and D6 to her attributes in a way that makes sense to you, based on her concept.</li>
<li>Choose how much of a challenge you want to present to your cavaliers; this will determine approximately how many experience points she’ll have. Generally speaking, you’ll want a major opponent to have about as many experience points as the sum of all your cavaliers, with a minimum of around 20 XP and a maximum around 200.</li>
<li>Consult the table, Opponent Creation, and choose one line representing how many experience points your major character will have.</li>
<li>She will have the listed number of ranks in each of her primary, secondary, and tertiary specialties, as well as competency in the associated skills – plus Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and Interaction.</li>
<li>Assign prowess in two to four types of weapons, zero to two types of armor, and two to four languages, based on your concept.</li>
<li>Pick her social class rank, assign one or more outfits, and equip her with whatever weapons, armor, and other equipment makes the most sense.</li>
<li>Most major characters will have two to four pieces of charmwoven apparel, with a charm die equal to their competency die. These charm dice usually assigned to one of the primary specialties or one of the tertiary ones.</li>
<li>Choose four Passions, assigning them in order from D12 to D6.</li>
<li>Pick three Style Maneuvers.</li>
<li>Finally, if she has any additional XP as shown on the table, spend those on whatever else you think might be fun. Extra style maneuvers or specialty ranks in Initiative are always good choices!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-of-major-character-creation">Example of Major Character Creation</h4>
<p>Let’s say you’ve decided you’re going to make a major character who is an important baroness from Varendia; in additional to her political position, she’s also an accomplished combatant, skilled with sword and pistol.</p>
<p>Looking over the list of specialties, we come up with the following primary specialties: Block, Parry, Riposte, Vigilance, and Aim. For secondary specialties, Lunge, Scholarship, Negotiate, Brawl, and Etiquette make sense. And as tertiary specialties, Intuition, Inspire, Strategy, Explore, and Carouse.</p>
<p>With a number of Affinity specialties, it makes sense for her to have a D10 for Affinity, with a D8 for Verve and a D6 for Guile.</p>
<p>The cavaliers in your game are pretty experienced; most have a D8 competency die and have spent around 25 XP each. With four players, that means that 100 XP is a good starting place for this major character’s abilities. However, checking the chart above, that would place her at a D12 competency die; we don’t want her to be too powerful, since she’ll have backup in the form of her loyal guards, so we’ll go with 80 XP instead.</p>
<p>This gives her a D10 Competency Die, +4 ranks in her primary specialties, +3 ranks in her secondary specialties, and +1 rank in her tertiary specialties. If she’s going to use Riposte, which is one of her primary specialties, she has a +4 ranks. With Strategy, she only has +1 rank.</p>
<p>Picking a name for our baroness, we come up with Ingunn von Sicherheim, and then fill in the rest of her stats as follows:</p>
<h4 id="ingunn-von-sicherheim">Ingunn von Sicherheim</h4>

<p>Ingunn, a Varendish noble, is a patriot first and foremost – at least when her pride doesn’t get in the way. Ambitious and thoughtful, she is a planner who involves herselves in a wide variety of schemes and plots. While most are practical nature, some are more personal and are aimed at avenging a perceived or actual sleight.</p>
<p>She will particularly try to humble any cavalier who dares to show her up in public, be that by turning down an offer employment, thwarting her plans, or simply knowing or achieving more than her.</p>
<p>Von Sicherheim is a tall, 35-year-old Varendian of pale complexion and a long mane of red hair. She has a large scar from a rifle wound on her left shoulder, but has no qualms about displaying this trophy of war even at formal occasions.</p>

<h3 id="animals">Animals</h3>
<p><em>The Queen’s Cavaliers</em> isn’t really a game about fighting wolves, crocodiles, or housecats – but just in case, here’s how animals work in the game.</p>
<h4 id="animal-attributes-and-specialties">Animal Attributes and Specialties</h4>
<p>While humans have Verve, Affinity, and Guile as attributes, animals are defined by the attributes Instinct, Ferocity, and Training. These can range from D0 to D12, and aren’t assigned as D10/D8/D6 as for human characters.</p>
<p>Animals don’t have skills, but each specialty is grouped under an appropriate attribute. There is one specialty, Perceive, that is classified as any attribute, and the Initiative skill has three new Specialties that don’t apply to humans.</p>
<h5 id="instinct">Instinct</h5>
<p>Instinctive specialties are those related to the survival of the animal, such as self-preservation or locating food.</p>
<p><strong>Dodge:</strong> This is used by most animals to avoid attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Explore:</strong> The Explore specialty is used for tracking, finding shelter, locating edible plants, or finding water.</p>
<p><strong>Feint:</strong> An animal will use Feint primarily to distract, although there are some faster animals which use it for attack.</p>
<p><strong>Flee (Initiative specialty):</strong> For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can Walk to an unoccupied area, and for 2 Initiative Points, it can Run to an unoccupied area. None of the human options for Initiative are available, such as Interpose, Reprise, or Seize the Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Perceive:</strong> This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on as an Item Die.</p>
<p><strong>Prowl:</strong> Animals that sneak up on targets, or hide from predators, are using the Prowl specialty.</p>
<h5 id="ferocity-specialties">Ferocity Specialties</h5>
<p>The Ferocity attribute is a measure of an animal’s aggression, determination, and fortitude. They’re primarily used offensively.</p>
<p><strong>Brawl:</strong> Animals use the Brawl specialty to grab hold of things, knock them down, or pin them to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Fight (Initiative specialty):</strong> For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can Seize the Initiative and immediately make a Lunge attack. For 2 Initiative Points, it can Seize the Initiative and make a Brawl or Riposte attack. It can’t use Initiative Points for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Inspire:</strong> Pack alphas often are able to Inspire bravery in their packmates, but most commonly this specialty is used to Inspire fear and scare off other creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Lunge:</strong> This is an aggressive attack using the natural weapons possessed by the animal, such as claws, sharp teeth, or horns. Those natural weapons add their Weapon die to Lunge attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Perceive:</strong> This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on as an Item Die.</p>
<p><strong>Riposte:</strong> Animals don’t Parry attacks, but they might be able to Riposte on a good Dodge roll or by using Initiative Points.</p>
<h5 id="training-specialties">Training Specialties</h5>
<p>Training specialties are things that animals must be taught or trained to do. This usually means being taught by humans, but sometimes wild animals are taught by other animals of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Arts:</strong> While very few animals actually create works of art, many birds will use the Art specialty to sing.</p>
<p><strong>Block:</strong> Sometimes an animal will have a tough enough hide or shell to be able to use the Block specialty. This can also be used by animals that are actually wearing some kind of armor, from horse barding to spiked collars. The animal can add the shell or armor’s Armor Die to its Block pool.</p>
<p><strong>Guard (Initiative):</strong> For 1 Initiative Point, the animal can Interpose itself to prevent a creature from entering its area. For 2 Initiative Points, the animal can make a Lunge, Brawl, or Feint attack against a creature that enters its area. The animal can’t spend its Initiative Points on anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Husbandry:</strong> This specialty is primarily possessed by working animals, such as dogs that herd sheep or oxen that pull plows.</p>
<p><strong>Larceny:</strong> Only a very few animals, such as ravens, can actually use Larceny to steal objects. Naturally, animals can’t make use of the black market.</p>
<p><strong>Perceive:</strong> This can fall under any animal Attribute. Animals use the skill just as humans do, but they often have senses that can be added on as an Item Die.</p>
<h4 id="scale">Scale</h4>
<p>Instead of a Competency Die, animals have a Scale Die that relates to how large they are. Scale also determines the yield limit and wound limit for the animal. For yield limits, “half Ferocity” means “half of the die size”, and “Ferocity” means “the die size.”</p>
<p><em>(table) Scale of Animals</em> | Scale | Scale Die | Yield Limit | Wound Limit | | ——— | ——— | —————— | ————————————————- | | Pocket | -- | 1 | 1 (Dead) | | Pet | 1D0 | 2 + half Ferocity | 1 (Dying) | | Companion | 1D6 | 3 + half Ferocity | 2 (Drop 1, Dying) | | Human | 1D8 | 4 + half Ferocity | 3 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Dying) | | Mount | 1D10 | 5 + Ferocity | 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying) | | Mammoth | 1D12 | 6 + Ferocity | 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying) | | Behemoth | 2D12 | 7 + twice Ferocity | 6 (Drop 0, Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying) |</p>
<p><strong>Pocket scale:</strong> This is the smallest category of animal – one that could be carried in a pocket. Examples include a rat, a songbird, or a tarantula.</p>
<p><strong>Pet scale:</strong> A pet-scale animal is around the size of a housecat or a small dog. Too big for a pocket, it can still be carried in one hand. Some examples are a trained parrot, a rooster, or a rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>Companion scale:</strong> A companion-scale animal isn’t quite as large as a human, but rather about the size of a medium to large dog. It takes both hands or arms to carry a companion-scale animal. Examples include a goat, a hunting dog, or a venomous snake.</p>
<p><strong>Human scale:</strong> Human-scale animals are approximately the size and weight of an adult human being. Some examples are a war dog, a ram, or a constrictor snake.</p>
<p><strong>Mount scale:</strong> Animals that are large enough to be ridden by a single human, or perhaps two or three with a tight squeeze, are mount scale. Examples include a warhorse, a bear, or a cow.</p>
<p><strong>Mammoth scale:</strong> Even larger than mount scale, mammoth-scale animals include orca, hordes, and elephants. They take up pretty much a normal-sized room.</p>
<p><strong>Behemoth scale:</strong> The largest of animals are behemoth scale. There are few of these left since the days of dragons (or dinosaurs; nobody’s quite sure which it is). The most notable examples of behemoth-scale animals are found in the oceans – such as a great whale or a giant squid.</p>
<h5 id="hordes">Hordes</h5>
<p>A horde is a swarm or pack of similar animals that work as one unit for game purposes. If 300 rats flood out into the sewers, you don’t really want to make individual rolls for all of them whenever they attack or defend.</p>
<p>A horde has an additional Attribute, called Horde. This is a measure of the horde’s consistency and cooperation. All Horde attributes start at D12.</p>
<p>The horde uses its Horde attribute as a Bonus Die in all of its die pools. However, when the horde takes wounds, the Horde die decreases to a D10, a D8, a D6, a D0, and then disperses. This replaces the normal Drop/Dying/Dead effects of wounds.</p>
<p>Most hordes are mammoth scale, although hordes of larger animals (such as sharks) might be behemoth scale, and smaller hordes such as a swarm of honeybees could be merely mount scale.</p>
<h4 id="other-animal-qualities">Other Animal Qualities</h4>
<p>Many of the game qualities of animals are similar to those of human characters. These are some of the ways they differ.</p>
<h5 id="movement-1">Movement</h5>
<p>A human can Walk 1 area, or Run 2 areas. Some animals are faster than this, and some are slower. The Walk and Run qualities tell you how many areas the animal can move using each type of action.</p>
<p>Some animals have special types of movement that humans can’t do, such as flying, swimming, or climbing. These allow an animal to move between Areas in ways that most humans can’t.</p>
<h5 id="senses">Senses</h5>
<p>Many animals have superior senses to humans; these are shown by the Senses quality. When using the specific type of sense, the animal can add that die on as an Item Die to Perceive rolls.</p>
<p>In addition, animals can use their best Attribute for calculating their Perceive pools, as Perceive is associated with Instinct, Ferocity, and Training.</p>
<h5 id="weapons-and-armor">Weapons and Armor</h5>
<p>Whether an animal has built-in weapons or armor – such as sharp teeth or a hard carapace – or is wearing an actual weapon or armor – barding, a spiked collar, and so on – it works the same way: the Item Die can be added to whatever skills are specified.</p>
<h5 id="maneuvers">Maneuvers</h5>
<p>Animals don’t gain style points. They don’t need them, so don’t spend any of their success points to buy style points. They don’t even know any style maneuvers anyway.</p>
<p>Instead they have conditional maneuvers that just happen whenever the condition is fulfilled.</p>
<p>For example, a great shark has the following maneuver: Blood in the Water (when attacking a target with at least 1 wound, add Perceive +1D12 to Lunge). This happens whenever it attacks a wounded target. No style points, no limited uses – just whenever the condition applies, it comes into play.</p>
<h5 id="impetus">Impetus</h5>
<p>Animals don’t have passions. They’re just animals, and concepts like Justice or Faith don’t really mean much to them. Instead, they have an Impetus – or maybe more than one Impetus.</p>
<p>These are the urges that drive an animal to action, much as passions do, but on a much more primal level.</p>
<p>Impetus types include:</p>
<p><strong>Curiosity:</strong> The animal just wants to know what’s going on over there, or across the way, or what’s behind the door. And it’s not like Curiosity ever killed any animals, right?</p>
<p><strong>Hunger:</strong> All animals are concerned with eating, but those with a Hunger Impetus will prioritize food and eating over nearly every other activity.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty: </strong>An animal with a Loyalty Impetus is a faithful companion to a human, usually its trainer or owner. They’re a human’s best friend.</p>
<p><strong>Obedience:</strong> A domesticated animal with the Obedience Impetus follows commands given to it. Not because it even likes the person giving the commands, but rather because it’s that well trained.</p>
<p><strong>Pack:</strong> The Pack Impetus represents those animals that stick together as a group, usually in some kind of hierarchy or family units.</p>
<p><strong>Predatory: </strong>A Predatory animal loves to hunt. Not just because it needs food, but because it’s actually a vicious hunter that likes to track down its prey.</p>
<p><strong>Survival: </strong>This is the most basic Impetus: the animal wants to stay alive. It will take any action necessary to do so, with the only exception being if it has a higher rated Impetus of another kind.</p>
<p><strong>Territory:</strong> A territorial animal will likely attack, or at least attempt to frighten off, other creatures that come within its territory.</p>
<p>You can use Impetus as you would use Passions – an animal can use each Impetus it possesses once in a story, and then it loses that specific Impetus. You can only use an Impetus if the animal’s actions are directly related to that Impetus.</p>
<p>For example, if an animal has a Survival (D6) Impetus, you can add that Bonus Die once to a Dodge pool or other defensive roll. A Predatory Impetus could be used for tracking or spotting something, an Obedience Impetus for staying alert, or a Curiosity Impetus for staying hidden while investigating some shiny new thing.</p>
