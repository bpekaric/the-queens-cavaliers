# Quickstart Rules

## How to Play

*The Queen's Cavaliers* (*TQC*) is a Baroque, swashbuckling, clockpunk
fantasy roleplaying game for 3 or more people. One person takes the role
of the Maitresse de Jeu (MJ) or “game master,” while the others are
players.

Each player creates a player character (PC) who is (in the default
campaign scenario) a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, a group of
champions devoted to the cause of Queen Mariana of Gallinea.

The MJ creates the rest of the world, playing out the characters,
groups, and natural environment that challenge the player characters and
provide the backdrop for them to spin their own story. Dramatic
conflicts, such as feats of derring-do or swordfights, are resolved by
each side rolling dice to determine success.

To play *TQC*, you will need a copy of the Character Sheet and Combat
Tracker for each PC, and a number of six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided,
and twelve-sided dice – six of each are recommended. You'll also need
some sort of tokens such as glass beads or small coins to track each
PC's status if a fight breaks out. Pencils, paper, and note cards (3x5
or similar) are useful too.

## Creating a Character

Creating a player character takes about 30 minutes to an hour, and can
be done by the players separately before the game, or at the first game
session. 

### For players:

Before beginning to make choices and fill in the character sheet, think
about what kind of character you'd like to make. Read over the
background information and the classes, and have a concept in mind, as
that can help you make decisions as you go through the character
creation process.

When you create your character, you'll be able to decide what she's good
at – is she primarily a swordfighter or a negotiator? A cunning sneak or
a bold ideologue? You'll want to remember that while *TQC* is a game with
romance, intrigue, and diplomacy, it's also primarily a swashbuckling
game – so you should also make sure your character can defend herself in
a fight.

### For the MJ:

Tell your players a little about the type of stories that you'd like to
tell, and if there are any particularly appropriate concepts or
personality types that will work best in the scenarios you have planned,
you can suggest those as well. However, don't be afraid to just let the
players' creativity and imaginations run wild.

## Attributes

Each character is described by three Attributes that describe her basic
strengths and weaknesses, as well as how she approaches life. Those
Attributes are Verve, Affinity, and Guile, and they are rated either D6,
D8, or D10.

A D10 in an Attribute indicates a high rating in that Attribute, while a
D6 indicates a low score and D8 is average. During the character
creation process, you get to choose one Attribute at D10, one at D8, and
one at D6.

### Verve

Your character's Verve score measures her youthful exuberance, her gusto
and gumption, her joie de vivre. Characters with a high Verve are
aggressive in combat and off the battlefield as well, and usually favor
a direct, brute-force approach to solving problems. Skill specialties
related to Verve include Brawl, Lunge, Parry, Inspire, and Perceive.

### Affinity

Affinity is your character's ability to grasp how the world operates,
both people and objects. Affinity includes a degree of intuition and
natural ability at skills; characters with high Affinity are often
builders, healers, or preservers. Aim, Treat, Intuition, Negotiate, and
Husbandry are examples of Affinity skill specialties.

### Guile

Your character's ability to think outside of the box is represented by
her Guile: her cleverness, her ingenuity, her slyness, her brilliance. A
character with high Guile often thinks in ways that bewilder or confuse
others, and rarely favor the straightforward approach. The skill
specialties Portents, Prowl, Deduce, and Deceive are related to Guile.

## Competency Die

Each *TQC* character has a Competency Die that represents their general
level of overall skill and life experience. New player characters begin
with a D6 Competency Die; you can add your Competency Die to any skill
check in which you're trained.

As a character increases in experience, her Competency Die will slowly
increase, as explained in the later section on Experience. A player
character's maximum Competency Die is D12.

### For the MJ: 

You can create non-player characters (NPCs) with no Competency Dice to
represent untrained characters, or characters with higher Competency
Dice to provide a greater challenge for experienced player characters. 

## Skills & Specialties

There are 12 Skills in *The Queen's Cavaliers*, ranging from Culture to
Streetwise. 

The basic level of training in a Skill is known as competency. If your
character is competent with a Skill, you get to add your Competency Die
to any rolls made with that Skill. Competency in a skill is represented
by a checkbox on the character sheet.

Once your character has competency in a Skill, you can also gain ranks
in the Specialties for the Skill.

There are three specialties for each skill, corresponding to the three
Attributes: Verve, Affinity, and Guile. For example, the Specialties for
Culture are Arts (Verve), Etiquette (Affinity), and Scholarship (Guile).

Specialties are ranked from +1 up to +5, although starting characters
can only gain a maximum of +2. Each rank represents one additional die –
of the same type as the Attribute die – that you can add to a dice pool
when attempting that skill or specialty.

*Example:* Your character has D10 for Guile, competency with Nature, and
+2 ranks of the Prowl specialty. That means that you get to include your
Competency die in your Nature (Prowl) roll, and you get to add 2
additional D10 dice (same size as your Guile die) to the pool.

## Item Dice & Charmwoven Gear

For certain skill rolls, you can add Item Dice to your pool, but only
one die per roll. The most common item dice are Weapon Dice and Armor
Dice, used in combat, but you can also get an Item Die for non-combat
rolls if you're using tools, such as chirurgeon's knives or a crowbar. 

You can also include one Charm Die in your roll. The world of Gallinea
has subtle magicks, and one common practice is the weaving of
enchantments into fashionable clothing. These Charms assist you with
specific Specialties by providing an extra die.

A charmwoven cloak may give a Dodge D6 bonus, while a cavalier hat could
provide Carouse D10.

*Example:* Because you envision your character sneaking around quite
often, you buy yourself a piece of charmwoven apparel: boots that
provide a Prowl D8 bonus.

## Making a Skill Roll

The primary mechanic in *TQC* is the skill roll. You make a roll by
gathering together a pool of dice and rolling them.

Your dice pool will consist of the following:

- Your relevant Attribute
- Your Competency Die, if you're competent in the skill
- One die for each rank you have of the appropriate Specialty, matching the size of your Attribute die
- One Item Die, if appropriate
- One Bonus Die, if appropriate

*Example:* You decide to use Prowl to get past a guard, so you start
building your dice pool. Prowl is a Specialty of the Nature skill, and
is associated with Guile.

The pool consists of: 

- First, your Guile D10.
- Then, because you're trained in Nature, you get to add your D6 Competency Die.
- Next, your two ranks (+2) in Prowl give you two additional dice of the same type as your Guile Attribute, so 2D10.
- No Item Dice apply, but your +1D8 Charm Die on your boots applies as a Bonus die.

Thus your total dice pool for this roll will be 1D10 + 1D6 + 2D10 + 1d6.

To see if you successfully sneak, you will roll that pool of dice. This dice pool can be abbreviated as 3D10+1D8+1D6.

## Reading a Skill Roll

Once you have rolled the dice, you need to read the results. You
calculate your total by keeping the two highest-rolling dice and
discarding all the rest. Add those two dice together for the total.

The lower die from the two you kept tells you the number of Success
Points you rolled. If you succeed in your action, you can spend those
Success Points to accomplish results.

*Example:* You have a dice pool of 3D10+1D8+1D6.  You roll the dice and get the following results:

| Die  | Result |
| :--: | :----: |
| D10  | 2      |
| D10  | 5      | 
| D10  | 7      |
| D8   | 6      |
| D6   | 3      |

The first thing you do is discard everything except the two highest rolling dice, leaving you with 7 and 6.

- Adding those together, you get a total of 13.
- The low die, a 6,  determines the number of Success Points.

So in this case, if you succeed, you would have six Success Points to spend.

### Rolling One Die

If you only roll one die, that die's number alone is the total, and your number of Success Points is always one.

## Drop Penalties

A Drop penalty is an adjustment to the number of dice you roll, based on
a negative or hindering quality affecting your character. The most
common Drop penalties are the results of Wounds, Combined Actions, Range
Penalties, or General Modifiers. 

Drop penalties are expressed as “Drop X,” where X is the number of dice
you must drop from your pool before rolling. “Drop 1” means to remove
one die, “Drop 2” means remove two dice, and so on.

When you drop dice, you get to choose which ones to drop. In nearly
every situation you're going to be dropping your dice with the smallest
size first, so D6 before D8, D10 before D12.

*Example:* You have a dice pool to roll for Prowl: 3D10+1D8+1D6.
However, you are suffering two Wounds, giving you a Drop 2 penalty. You
drop the D8 and the D6, leaving 3D10.

You roll those dice, getting the following results:

| Die  | Result |
| :--: | :----: |
| D10  | 2      |
| D10  | 3      | 
| D10  | 7      |

These total to 10, with three potential Success Points.

## Opposition Dice

Whenever you make a Skill Roll of any kind, you are making an opposed
check – either against an opponent or against Standard Opposition dice.

When facing an opponent – such as trying to negotiate against someone or
stab them with a sword – the opponent gets to make an appropriate
defense or opposition roll. This is dependent upon the situation; for a
Negotiate roll, the appropriate opposition is likely another Negotiate
roll, while a Lunge can be opposed by a Parry, Block, or Dodge.

*Example:* While Prowling around, you fail a roll and are spotted by a
guard. She demands to know what you're doing and if you're supposed to be 
there. You aren't actually supposed to be there, so you need to make up a
story to convince her. This requires the use of the Deceive specialty.

Deceive is a Guile specialty under the Interaction skill, and you're
competent with Deceive. You have 1 rank in the Deceive specialty. 
In addition, you have a charmwoven hat with a Deceive +1D6 Charm Die.
Your dice pool is 1D10 + 1D6 + 1D10 + 1D6, or 2D10 + 2D6.

The opposition dice will be the guard's Intuition roll. The guard has an
Affinity of D10, a D6 Competency Die, and +1 rank in Intuition. Her dice
are 1D10 + 1D6 + 1D10, or 2D10 + 1D6.

You roll 2D10 + 2D6 and get 9, 3, 2, 3 for a total of 12 with three success points.

The MJ then rolls for the guard's Intuition specialty and gets 6, 2, and 5. 
Her total is 11 and her success points are five.

Because her total is lower than yours, you succeeded on your Deceive roll
and she buys your story.

## Standard Opposition

If you are making a roll which isn't opposed by another character (PC or
NPC), the MJ will roll Standard Opposition dice – such as if you are
walking a tightrope, picking a lock, or reciting a poem.

The number of Standard Opposition dice is always three, but the type of
dice vary depending on the difficulty level set by the MJ.

### For the MJ: 

Select the size of dice to roll by consulting this table:

| Difficulty Level | Standard Opposition |
| :--------------- | :------------------ |
| Very Easy        | Automatic success   |
| Easy             | 3D6                 |
| Moderate         | 3D8                 |
| Difficult        | 3D10                |
| Very Difficult   | 3D12                |

A Very Easy task should automatically succeed; they just happen,
especially if they fit the genre of the game.

You can use Standard Opposition dice in a number of situations in which
you don't have a specific NPC opposing an action. If a PC is trying to
influence a crowd, just choose 3D6 or 3D8 to represent the difficulty in
influencing the crowd.

**Design note:** Examples of Difficulty Levels need to be given. The Skills
document will list some of them.

## Spending Success Points

Once you have succeeded at a skill roll, you can spend your Success
Points to produce results.

Each Specialty has one or more associated Success Tables. This is what
the Success Table for Deceive looks like:

| Deceive     |                    |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| Time:       | Free Roll          |
| Opposition: | Intuition          |
| +:          | Think on Your Feet |
| ++:         | Appear Sincere     |
| +++:        | Gain 1 Style Point |
| ++++:       | Appear Trustworthy |

You can spend your Success Points and achieve the desired results. Each
“+” indicates the expenditure of one Success Point. 

The results you can achieve are dependent upon the shared reality of the
fictional world. In other words, if there's no way you can convince the
guard that your lie is true -- for example, if you told the guard that you're
her sister and she clearly knows her own family -- then you can't choose to
appear trustworthy. A Deceive roll isn't mind control!

If applicable and appropriate, you can choose a result more than once.
It doesn't make sense to appear sincere twice, so you can't
choose that multiple times, but if you had the success points you could
gain mutiple style points.

It's possible that you may run out of things to spend Success Points on.
In such a case, the extra points you don't spend are simply unused and go away.

*Example:* You have three Success Points and succeeded on your Deceive roll.
You decide to spend your Success Points as follows:

- +: Think on Your Feet -- you quickly come up with a good lie.  "I'm the ... inspector!
  I'm here to inspect ... all the things!"

- ++: Appear Sincere -- you don't seem like you're obviously lying, so the guard believes you.

## Style Points

Style Points are a limited resource which you can use to improve your
dice rolls. You start each game session with one Style Point and can
gain more by spending Success Points with successful skill rolls. Three
Success Points will earn you one Style Point. However, you can only have
a maximum of three Style Points at any time.

*Example:* You score six Success Points on a Deceive roll, and spend your Success
Points like this:

- +: Think on Your Feet

- ++: Appear Sincere

- +++: Gain 1 Style Point

Every time you gain a Style Point, you are required to describe what
your character has done that is particularly stylish. You can't overly
bend the narrative of the game – your stylish description can't have any
mechanical effect – but you can use the opportunity to make your
character perform an impressive act that is unique to her personality
and style.

*Example:* You choose to Think on Your Feet, Appear Sincere, and Gain 1 Style Point. The MJ
asks you, “what do you do that's so stylish while you're tricking the guard?" You answer:

"I give a dashing and reassuring smile as I tell this outlandish lie, a sparkle
of moonlight reflecting off my teeth with a 'glint!' sound. With confident 
assurance, I tell her that I'm here to perform an inspection, and I even hint
that if she doesn't comply, she may be in trouble with her superiors."

“Awesome\! That happens,” says the MJ. And you earn your Style Point.

### For the MJ:

It's perfectly within your rights to veto any stylish description if you
think it's too absurd, but most of the time you should let players get
away with whatever they want to describe. It's their Style Point and
thus their chance to narrate.

The only time that you should definitely step in is when you feel a
description isn't stylish *enough.* Then you can prompt the player for
more awesomeness and encourage them toward an over-the-top, flamboyant
display.

## Style Maneuvers

Each player character starts with two Style Maneuvers and can purchase
more with Experience Points. Style Maneuvers each cost one or two Style Points to use.

Unlike *gaining* Style Points, you are not required to narrate something
stylish when you *use* a Style Maneuver (but you can if you want to\!).

There are three types of Style Maneuvers: Maximize, Reroll, and Add.

### Maximize (Specialty)

This Style Maneuver lets you spend two Style Point, then take one of the
Specialty Dice of the appropriate Specialty and set that die to its
maximum value before rolling. You don't roll that die, just set it to
its highest value and set it aside, then include it after you roll.

You can only have one maximized die in any given skill roll. (You can't
spend two Style Points and maximize two dice.) 

*Example:* You have the Style Maneuver “Maximize Deceive.” You can spend two
Style Points to set one of your D10 dice to its maximum value before
rolling. That gives you an automatic 10 on that die. You then roll the other
dice -- 1D10 + 2D6 -- getting a 2, a 3, and a 2. 

Adding the 10 to the 3, you get a total of 13 with three success points. Nice!

### Reroll (Skill)

This Style Maneuver lets you reroll a roll that you just made. Spend a
Style Point, pick up all the dice (except maximized dice, of course) and
reroll them.

You can reroll the same skill roll as many times as you like, until you
run out of Style Points.

*Example:* You make your Deceive roll and get 4, 2, 3, and 2. That's really
low -- a total of 7 with 3 success points. 

You have a Style Maneuver “Reroll Interaction.” You spend a Style Point and
reroll the dice, and get a much better roll: 7, 9, 2, 6.  Hooray\! 
This is a total of 16 and seven Success Points.

### Add (One Specialty) to (Another Specialty)

This Style Maneuver lets you add your Specialty dice to another roll.
You add only the Specialty dice – of the same size as the first
Specialty's related Attribute.

You can only use each Add Style Maneuver once per roll, although you
could use additional, different Style Maneuvers together on the same
roll if they all apply.

*Example:* You have a Style Maneuver that lets you add your Banter dice
to your Deceive roll. Normally your Deceive roll is 2D10 + 2D6.
You have +2 ranks in Banter (a Verve specialty), and your Verve is D8,
so you get to add 2D8 (not your entire Perceive dice pool) to your Deceive
roll. 

Your Deceive dice pool is now 2D10 + 2D8 + 2D6. You roll the dice and get
4, 9, 8, 2, 4, and 3.  Hooray\! This is a total of 17 and eight Success Points.

## Experience

Each game session of *The Queen's Cavaliers* gives you three to five
Experience Points (XP), which you use to improve your player character.
The cost for each improvement is shown in the following table.

| Character Improvement      | Cost                  | Notes                  |
| :------------------------  | :-------------------: | :--------------------- |
| New Skill Competency       | 3 XP                  |                        |
| Specialty Rank, per rank:  | Equal to the new rank |                        |
| \+0 to +1                  | 1 XP                  |                        |
| \+1 to +2                  | 2 XP                  | (3 XP from +0 to +2)   |
| \+2 to +3                  | 3 XP                  | (6 XP from +0 to +3)   |
| \+3 to +4                  | 4 XP                  | (10 XP from +0 to +4)  |
| \+4 to +5                  | 5 XP                  | (15 XP from +0 to +5)  |
| New Language               | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Weapon Prowess             | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Armor Prowess              | 1 XP                  |                        |
| Add a Style Maneuver       | 5 XP                  |                        |

Note that there is no cost listed for improving your character's
Attributes\! Your Attributes are fixed for the life of your character as
they represent innate qualities unique to her. If you have a D6 Verve at
the start of your career with the Queen's Cavaliers, you'll have a D6
Verve at the end.

Once you have spent (not earned, spent) a certain number of Experience
Points on improvements, your character's Competency Die will improve, as
shown on the table below. In addition, the maximum number of ranks your
character can have in any one Specialty increases.

| XP Spent | Competency Die | Maximum Specialty Rank |
| :------: | :------------: | :--------------------: |
| 0        | D6             | \+2                    |
| 20       | D8             | \+3                    |
| 50       | D10            | \+4                    |
| 100      | D12            | \+5                    |

Experience points can be spent between game sessions, at the beginning
of a session, at the end of a session, or between scenes. You can't
spend your experience points during a scene, however.

### For the MJ:

The XP system is flexible and relies on your judgment as to how many
points to award per session, although the default is three XP to five XP
for a typical session of four hours of game play.
In general, you should only give out XP at the end of a session, not
immediately after each scene.
