### Example of Major Character Creation

Let's say you’ve decided you’re going to make a major character who is
an important baroness; in additional to her political
position, she's also an accomplished combatant, skilled with sword and
pistol.

Looking over the list of specialties, we come up with the
following primary specialties: Block, Parry, Riposte, Vigilance, and
Aim. For secondary specialties, Lunge, Scholarship, Negotiate, Brawl,
and Etiquette make sense. And as tertiary specialties, Intuition,
Inspire, Strategy, Explore, and Carouse.

With a number of Affinity specialties, it makes sense for her to have a
D10 for Affinity, with a D8 for Verve and a D6 for Guile.

The players in your game are pretty experienced; most have a D8
competency die and have spent around 25 XP each. With four players, that
means that 100 XP is a good starting place for this major character's
abilities. However, checking the chart above, that would place her at a
D12 competency die; we don't want her to be too powerful, since she'll
have backup in the form of her loyal guards, so we'll go with 80 XP
instead.

This gives her a D10 Competency Die, +4 ranks in her primary
specialties, +3 ranks in her secondary specialties, and +1 rank in her
tertiary specialties. If she's going to use Riposte, which is one of her
primary specialties, she has a +4 ranks. With Strategy, she only has +1
rank.

Filling in the rest of her stats, we arrive at:
