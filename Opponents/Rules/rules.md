## (subchapter) Types of Opponents

There are several types of opponents that can present challenges,
both in combat and out of combat, for player characters. These opponents
are rated in terms of how important they are to the story: rabble
are at best extras, while minor opponents take supporting roles. Major
opponents, of course, can challenge a group of cavaliers as major
villains or powerful allies\!

##### (sidebar) Using Opponents

Don't assume that all opponents are there to fight\! A corrupt noble,
scheming artisan, angry soldier, or even hapless rabble could complicate
the heroes' lives without even lifting a finger.

Use opposed rolls, such as a duplicitous politician's Deception vs. a
player's Negotation, to represent a duel of words -- trying to to
convince a court of one's guilt or innocence.

Don't make rolls against Standard Opposition for opponents, though --
you shouldn't ever be rolling against yourself\! Either find a way for
the player to oppose the roll, or just decide via fiat whether the
opponent succeeds or not.

Similarly, if an opponent is actually friendly and wishes to help the
cavaliers, use the rule for assisting to have them grant additional dice
to the players' rolls.

### (section) Rabble

Usually appearing in groups, rabble are faceless opposition who
don't present a major challenge to the player characters. Rabble have
the following characteristics:

  - D0 or D6 Competency die
  - Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die
  - Yield Limit of 3
  - Wound Limit of 1 (after taking 1 wound, they are Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D6/D6, D8/D8/D8, or D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +1 Specialty Ranks
  - Two Passions (D8, D6)
  - No Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point
  - Usually appear in groups (up to twice the number of PCs)

### (section) Stock Character

A stock character is one that has a tangible role in the
game but probably doesn't need a name; instead, they are identified by
their profession or story role. Characteristics of stock characters
include:

  - Competency die usually D6 (D8 or higher for elite characters)
  - Wealth pool based on 1 Social Rank die plus Competency die
  - Yield Limit equal to 3 plus half the maximum value of their
    Competency die
  - Wound Limit of 2 (Drop 1, Dying)
  - Attributes of D8/D8/D8 or D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties (or higher for
    elite characters)
  - Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)
  - One or Two Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 0 Style Points, with a maximum of 1 Style Point
  - Sometimes appear in groups (one per PC), or sometimes lead groups of
    rabble

### (section) Minor Character

A minor character usually has a name, and has more of
a background (and usually more skills) than a stock
character or rabble. Minor characters have the following
characteristics:

  - Competency die usually D6 or D8 (D10 or higher for elite characters)
  - Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die
  - Yield Limit equal to 3 plus the maximum value of their Competency
    die
  - Wound Limit of 4 (Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +2 Specialty Ranks in three Specialties
  - Three Passions (D10, D8, D6)
  - Two Style Maneuvers
  - Start with 1 Style Point, with a maximum of 3 Style Points
  - Usually appear singly although often found in groups of minor
    characters or stock characters as leaders, or as henchpersons of
    major characters

### (section) Major Character

Major characters always have names, and play a key role as opponents
(or allies) for the player characters. All should have complex
motivations and are built as player characters are built, with just a
few exceptions. Characteristics of major characters include:

  - Competency die of D8 or higher, and corresponding experience points
    spent
  - Wealth pool based on 2 Social Rank dice plus Competency die 
  - Yield limit equal to 6 plus the maximum value of their Competency
    die
  - Wound limit of 5 (Drop 0, Drop 1, Drop 2, Drop 4, Dying)
  - Attributes of D6/D8/D10
  - Maximum of +3 Specialty Ranks (higher for elite characters); built
    as per player characters with experience points
  - Four Passions (D12, D10, D8, D6)
  - Three Style Maneuvers, plus additional if bought with experience
    points
  - Start with 3 Style Points, with a maximum of 6 Style Points
  - Are unique individuals in the world
  - Have full character sheets as do player characters

### (section) Customizing Opponents

You can adjust opponents to represent other types of characters in the
world; for example, a Pirate Crewmember could be used as the basis for
an Ekalian Navy Sailor by changing her Passions.

Some of the ways you can customize the opponents listed in
this chapter include:

  - Increasing the size of the Competency die (from D6 to D8, for
    example)
  - Adding or removing specialty ranks (up to the maximum value)
  - Changing equipment
  - Upping the Yield Limit or Wound Limit
  - Altering the character's Passions
  - Adding, removing, or changing a Style Maneuver
  - Adding, removing, or changing a Language
