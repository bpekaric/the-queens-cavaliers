### Dragosan History

*introdcution needed*

### Volstok, Capital of Dragosa

*description needed*

##### Talanian Refugees

Former inhabitants of Talania, fleeing from the encroachment of the
Shattering Frost, have flooded the northern and central parts of
Dragosa. These immigrants are seen to threaten the multicultural nature
of Dragosa by lack of fluency in Ekalian and Varendish, and as such are
limited in what roles they can play in Dragosan society. With the
inability to return to their ancestral homelands, the Talanian refugees
are at risk of becoming a permanent lower class within Dragosa.

#### The Lexicographer

With a diverse, multilingual nation, the people of Dragosa are often
themselves amateur linguists. Some of the most respected scholars in
Volstok are found in the Institute of Translation, where they catalogue
words, rephrase idioms, transliterate classic works in other tongues,
and decipher fragmentary texts.

Field researchers from the Institute range far and wide throughout
Elara, Ifran, and beyond -- seeking to capture jkkke in the wild and
bind it into book form, for storage in their guild's libraries.

#### The Hanaster

Dragosan merchants do a lot of trade both within and outside of Dragosa,
with many willing to travel quite far in order to earn gold dragas.
Serica, the Coffee Coast, Mwene Karanga, the Storm Islands -- nowhere is
too far to go if a profit can still be turned by the journey. The
highest ranking merchants are part of the Hanaster guilds, and are
effectively nobility within Dragosan cities.

Hanasters are skilled at turning a profit, knowing what is most valuable
at any given location and where it can be acquired for the cheapest.
Most train in the basics of self defense, if just to protect themselves
from thievery.
