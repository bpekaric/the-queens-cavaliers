# **(chapter) Chapter 4:** Skills and Specialties

There are 12 skills in The Queen's Cavaliers, ranging from Culture to
Streetwise. Each of these skills has three specialties, corresponding to
the three Attributes of Verve, Affinity, and Guile.

### (section) Using Skills

To use a skill, first you determine under which specialty the task you
want to perform falls. Your dice pool starts with one die of that
specialty's corresponding attribute; this is your Attribute Die.

If you have competency in that skill, you can add your Competency Die to
the dice pool. There are four skills that all player characters are
competent at using: Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and Observation.

You can have +0, +1, +2, +3, +4, or +5 ranks in each specialty, although
a starting character is initially limited to only +2 ranks. Each rank
adds an additional die of the same size as your Attribute Die to the
dice pool; these are your Specialty Dice.

Many specialties allow you to add an Item Die from a tool or item to the
dice pool as well, as described under the separate listings for each
specialty. Weapon Dice and Armor Dice are subcategories of Item Dice;
you can only add a Weapon or Armor die if you have prowess with that
weapon or armor. You can have only one Item Die in any given dice pool.

You might have a Bonus Die that you can include in your dice pool under
certain circumstances. Tag Dice and Advantage Dice are subcategories of
Bonus Dice. A Tag Die is temporary and is based on a word, a phrase, a
person, a place, a thing, or a concept. Your Advantage Die is used in
combat, and can progress from +1D6 up to +1D12. You can only have one
Bonus Die in a dice pool.

Factors that make your skills harder to use assign a Drop Penalty to
your dice pool. Such factors range from Wounds to language barriers.
Each Drop Penalty specifies a number of dice that are dropped -- meaning
removed -- from your dice pool before you roll. A Drop 2 penalty means
you remove 2 dice. You can choose which dice to drop, and so you're
going to want to drop the smallest size dice.

Once you've finished constructing your dice pool, you roll all the dice
at once. You select the dice that resulted in the highest two numbers,
and you discard the results of the other dice. Then you see what the MJ
rolls on the opposition dice.

There are two types of opposition dice. Some are rolls of your
opponent's corresponding specialty, such as her Defense (Parry) roll
against your Dueling (Lunge) roll. In other situations you might be
rolling against standard opposition, rolled by the MJ. Standard
opposition pools consist of three dice of the same size, from Easy (3D6)
to Very Difficult (3D12).

###### (table) Standard Opposition

|            |                    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Difficulty | Opposing Dice Pool |
| Very Easy  | Automatic success  |
| Easy       | 3D6                |
| Moderate   | 3D8                |
| Hard       | 3D10               |
| Very Hard  | 3D12               |

(end table)

The total of your roll is the sum of the two dice you kept after
rolling. The success points generated by your roll equal the lower of
the two dice. If you beat the total of the opposition dice, then you can
spend those success points on the success table for that specialty.
Otherwise, your opponent can spend her success points.

You can usually buy a result from a success table multiple times, unless
it says otherwise in the description of the specialty. Success points
you don't use are simply discarded when you finish buying the results
you want.

One of the most common ways to spend success points is to buy a style
point for 3 success points. You use style points to power your style
maneuvers, which let you combine together the Specialty Dice of two
different specialties, set one die in a pool to its maximum value before
you roll, or reroll a result that you don't like. You can only have 3
style points at a time, so if you already have 3, you can't buy any
more.

The skills, specialties, and their corresponding attributes used The
Queen's Cavaliers are shown in the following table:

| Streetwise  | Banter          | Carouse            | Larceny         |

(end table)

Skills and Specialties are described below, with a Success Table for
each Specialty. You gain a set of skills and specialties from each of
your classes (or backstory), and additional skills and specialty ranks
from customizing your character. As you gain experience points, you can
spend XP to increase your ranks in your specialties, or add new skills.

The Success Tables that follow are meant to be a guideline for you and
the MJ to determine what happens based on any given roll. They are not
meant to override the fictional narrative; a result can only happen if
it makes sense in the context of the story.

At the MJ's discretion, a different table can be used for any Specialty
– or a result from any Success Table – for the price of one additional
Success Point. This allows for flexibility in player actions by
comparing against similar tasks, and using those results.

## (subchapter) Culture

The Culture skill includes arts, history, religion, language, mythology,
music, customs, traditions, noble families, and other societal elements
found in the cultures of Elara and Ifran.

The Culture specialties are often used as knowledge rolls.

### (section) Arts

##### Verve Specialty

Sculpture, music, painting, poetry, sketching, woodcuts, writing, dance,
acting, and other forms of art are used to convey the core values of
Elaran society. The Arts specialty includes not just basic knowledge of

creative works.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a piece of art, spot a forgery, remember
the name of a famous artist, identify tools and instruments used in art
or music.

**Crafting: **Create works of art such as drawings, poetry, paintings,
sculptures, plays, songs, opera, novellas, and more, as described in
Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Bonus Die: **If you are performing an existing work of art, such as a
musical composition or a play, you can include the work's Tag Die as a
Bonus Die.

**Opposition:** Under most situations, an Arts roll will automatically
succeed and the success points will determine the quality of the
performance. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard Opposition of
Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.

the scene, and can be used with other Specialties as a Bonus Die when
appropriate. You can make one additional Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for
each success point you spend.

die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks you have in

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Encore, Encore\!: **You give such a successful performance that no one
in the audience will ever forget it, or you. Any Tag Dice from this
performance last for 24 hours and are automatically maximized.

### (section) Etiquette

##### Affinity Specialty

The Etiquette specialty encompasses general knowledge about the customs,
politics, traditions, and manners of the cultures of Elara and Ifran,
including the use of proper etiquette while in a noble court.

**Foreign Etiquette:** When dealing with people from other countries or
cultures, you get a Drop 2 penalty on Etiquette rolls. If you do not
share a common language, the penalty increases to a Drop 4 penalty.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a member of the royal court, read a
heraldic coat of arms, remember the correct form of address for a noble
title, recall court gossip about a baroness, cite the local laws and
customs.

**Opposition:** Under most situations, an Etiquette roll will
automatically succeed and the success points will determine the quality
of one's behavior. Under less than ideal circumstances, Standard
Opposition of Easy (3D6) or higher may be required.

**Bonus Die:** Add your own highest Social Rank Die as a Bonus Die when
making an Etiquette roll.

success point you spent, the social rank you impress increases by one.

**Improve Impression:** You increase the Tag Die by one step for every
two success points you spend. The size of the Tag Die limited by your

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Pass as Different Social Rank:** You affect the mannerisms and
presence of a different social rank. You can pass as a social rank one
higher than your highest social rank, or as a social rank one lower than
your lowest social rank. Until the end of the scene, both of your social
rank dice are considered equal to the new social rank. You lose this
bonus if you commit a social faux pas or otherwise fail to act in
accordance with the airs you've put on.

### (section) Scholarship

##### Guile Specialty

In Gallinea, a well-rounded education is the mark of a civilized woman
or man. The Scholarship specialty represents your breadth of book
learning and ability to do research when necessary. As such, it is used
very often for knowledge rolls and rarely for anything else.

**Language:** For every rank you have in Scholarship, you gain an
additional language prowess of your choice.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall basic historical knowledge, identify a
spoken or written language, remember a piece of trivia, name some of the
most prestigious universities and their professors, understand and
disagree with an obscure theological argument.

**Crafting:** Write research reports, translations, or non-fiction
books, as described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on your Scholarship to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Culture (Scholarship), as shown on the following
table:

###### (table) Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

|                   |           |                           |

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Teach a Lesson:** If you spend at least an hour teaching someone, she
can temporarily gain Competency in one Skill or language in which you
have Competency. This Competency lasts for 24 hours after your
instruction ends. For each additional Success Point you spend, you can
teach another student at the same time. A student can only learn one
such temporary Competency at any time, from any teacher.

## (subchapter) Defense

The Defense skill is used in combat to avoid taking damage. Whenever you
are attacked, you can choose which of the appropriate Defense
specialties you will use, although depending on the type of attack, your
Defense choices may be limited by the type of attack. For example, you
can't really Parry a bullet.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Defense skill.

**Wounds:** Defense rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

### (section) Parry

##### Verve Specialty

A Parry is an attempt to block an attack with a weapon or a buckler; you
need to be wielding something in one of your hands in order to make a
Parry.

The primary advantage of a Parry is that if you successfully Parry, you
can also execute a Riposte – if you've got enough Success Points to do
so. You can only execute one Riposte per Parry.

**Wounds:** Parry rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Possibility of Weapon Breakage:** If you use Parry to defend against a
Lunge attack and are unsuccessful, one possible result for the attacker
is to break your weapon.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's
fencing style.

**Crafting:** Bucklers and extra shields, as described in Chapter 10,
"Crafting."

**Opposition:** A Parry can be used against an attacker's Lunge, Feint,
or Brawl roll, but not against a Riposte or Aim attack.

and the attacker from spending her Success Points. If you don't do this,
the attack still takes effect on you, with the attacker spending her
Success Points normally.

**Execute a Riposte:** You can make a Riposte attack. This is the only
way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful Parry or
Feint.

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to
attack you. (This can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.)
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

### (section) Block

##### Affinity Specialty

A Block roll is an attempt to prevent injury to yourself by using armor,
a shield, nearby furniture, terrain, or even a less vulnerable part of
your own body.

**Wounds:** Block rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a suit of armor or a
shield, remember the names of famous soldiers, identify the blacksmith's
maker's mark on armor.

**Opposition:** A Block roll can be used to defend against an attacker's
Lunge, Riposte, or Aim roll, but not against a Feint or Brawl attack.

rolls don't include Weapon or Armor Dice, but you can use a Dodge roll
to defend against any type of attack.

**Wounds:** Dodge rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty is not often used to make knowledge

**Wounds:** Dueling rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your
Wounds.

### (section) Lunge

##### Verve Specialty

A Lunge is a basic attack and can be attempted with any hand-held

Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

**Break Weapon:** You snap your target's blade. You can only do this if
your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails. A broken weapon is
useless except as an improvised weapon.

### (section) Riposte

##### Affinity Specialty

successful Parry or Feint. By catching your opponent off-guard, you can
slip past her normal defenses.

Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a Dueling weapon's quality, remember the

is dying.

### (section) Feint

##### Guile Specialty

A Feint is a false attack designed to get your opponent to lower her
defenses. The primary advantage of a Feint is to build Advantage against

although you can inflict Yield.

**Wounds:** Feint rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate a Dueling weapon's quality, remember the
names of famous duelists, identify the national origin of someone's

way to use the Riposte specialty; it has to follow a successful Parry or
Feint.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using to
Parry you. You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your
Area, in an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

## (subchapter) Initiative

The Initiative skill is used in combat to determine who goes first, as
well as to take additional actions during a fight. The order of
Initiative is set by a free roll at the beginning of each fight, or when
each combatant enters the fight. 

Generally, a character only needs to have ranks in one Initiative
specialty, usually corresponding to her highest Attribute Die.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Initiative skill.

### (section) Impulse

##### Verve Specialty

The Impulse specialty is favored by combatants who have high Verve, and
is characterized by acting quickly to Seize the Initiative.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty cannot be used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Opposition:** Initiative rolls are automatically successful, and
ranked in order by the MJ from highest (first to act) to lowest (last to
act).

###### (success table) Impulse

**Time:** Free Roll

**Opposition:** Automatically Successful

**+:** Seize the Initiative

**++:** Interpose

**+++:** Reprise Attack

(end success table)

**Seize the Initiative:** For one round, you jump ahead in the
Initiative order, before someone else is about to act. The next round,
you act at your normal place in the Initiative order.

**Interpose:** For one attack, you makes yourself the target of someone
else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This can be
used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined action
with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately, an
Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. You can Interpose only once per round.

**Reprise Attack:** If you failed on an attack roll, you can repeat the
attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. You can Reprise
Attack only once per round.

### (section) Vigilance

##### Affinity Specialty

Vigilance is favored by combatants who have high Affinity and who look
to protect others, because they are able to Interpose most easily during
a fight.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty cannot be used to make knowledge
rolls.

act).

###### (success table) Vigilance

**Opposition:** Automatically Successful

**+:** Interpose

**++:** Reprise Attack

**+++:** Seize the Initiative

(end success table)

**Interpose:** For one attack, you makes yourself the target of someone
else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This can be
used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined action
with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately, an
Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. You can Interpose only once per round.

**Reprise Attack:** If you failed on an attack roll, you can repeat the
attack. This can't be used after a successful attack. You can Reprise
Attack only once per round.

**Seize the Initiative:** For one round, you jump ahead in the
Initiative order, before someone else is about to act. The next round,
you act at your normal place in the Initiative order.

### (section) Timing

##### Guile Specialty

The Timing specialty allows the combatant to Reprise an Attack on a
failed roll, and is of most use to those with high Guile.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty cannot be used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Opposition:** Initiative rolls are automatically successful, and
ranked in order by the MJ from highest (first to act) to lowest (last to
act).

you act at your normal place in the Initiative order.

**Interpose:** For one attack, you makes yourself the target of someone
else's attack, instead of the attacker's intended target. This can be
used to protect any target in the same Area, or as a combined action
with a Move to protect a target in an adjacent Area. Alternately, an
Interpose can be used to prevent an opponent in the same Area from
leaving that Area; this blocks the opponent's movement but does not
redirect the attack. You can Interpose only once per round.

## (subchapter) Interaction

The Interaction skill covers social interactions between individual
characters, as well as characters addressing a group.

**Automatic Competency:** Player characters in *The Queen's Cavaliers*
are automatically Competent with the Interaction skill.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 2 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

### (section) Inspire

##### Verve Specialty

The Inspire specialty covers all attempts to instill a particular
feeling in another person (or group of people) – such as to make her
angry, enthusiastic, happy, frightened, or sad.

Inspire isn't a kind of mind control; someone won't take an action that
they are opposed to doing. But you can provoke her to give some kind of
reaction to your words.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall an inspiring speech from history or fiction,
remember the names of great leaders.

**Opposition:** In most situations, an Inspire roll is an automatic
success. If you have a language barrier or other Drop Penalty applied,
the difficulty increases to Easy (3D6) or higher.

###### (success table) Inspire

**Time:** 1 action

**Opposition:** Automatic success or standard opposition

\++: Increase Tag Die

**++:** Reduce an Ally's Yield

**++:** Inflict 1 Yield

**+++:** Instill Emotion

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**+++:** Provoke Reaction

(end success table)

**Inspiring Speech:** Your words start to sway those who hear them. You
can create a tag based on an emotional state, with a +1D0 Tag Die. This
Tag Die lasts until the end of the scene, and can be used with other
Specialties as a Bonus Die when appropriate. You can make one additional
Tag with a +1D0 Bonus Die for each success point you spend.

**Increase Tag Die: **One Tag Die created by your inspiring speech
improves by one die size. You are limited by the number of skill ranks
you have in Interaction (Inspire), as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

|              |           |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Inspire Rank | Bonus Die |
| 1            | \+1D0     |
| 2            | \+1D6     |
| 3            | \+1D8     |
| 4            | \+1D10    |
| 5            | \+1D12    |

**Reduce an Ally's Yield:** If an ally who can hear you has taken Yield,
you can reduce it by spending two Success Points per point of Yield.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** One opponent who can hear you takes one Yield for
every two Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or
exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Instill Emotion:** Choose one of the Tags you have active in this
scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends for you. One person who
can hear you gains either a Drop Penalty or a Bonus Die on all actions
related to that Tag, your choice. For each additional success point you
spend, you can affect another person. The Drop Penalty decreases after
each time it's applied, and the Bonus Die decreases in size after each
use.

###### (table) Inspire Results

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Provoke Reaction:** You cause someone who can hear you to react to
your words, even if she doesn't really want to. Choose one of the Tags
you have active in this scene. That specific Tag Die immediately ends
for you. The person you've affected will react on her next turn based on
that Tag. You don't get to choose the specific reaction, and it's
instead based on how she would normally react to such feelings. For
example, if you use a Tag Die of Anger, her response might be to attack
you, to fire a scathing insult at you, to burst into tears, to order
someone else to attack you, to leave the area, or to mock your clothing
choices.

### (section) Negotiate

##### Affinity Specialty

Negotiate covers diplomatic attempts to persuade someone, to compromise,
or give something up in return for something else. In general, to use
Negotiate you must be offering a bargaining chip of some kind, although
it need not be a completely fair trade. 

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** A Negotiate roll for something simple, like haggling over
goods, takes one minute. More complicated business deals or diplomacy
take an hour or more.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the price of an object, recall details on
treaties, remember something the other party might have overlooked.

**Crafting:** Contracts, treaties, and other legal documents, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Negotiate rolls are always opposed by the other party's
Negotiate rolls. If there isn't a party in opposition to you, you
probably aren't in a negotiation.

**Float a Proposal:** You propose a course of action, and create a +1D0
Tag Die based on that proposal. Until the end of the scene, you can use
that Tag Die as a Bonus Die on appropriate rolls, including further
Negotiate rolls -- or Wealth rolls if you are haggling over a purchase.
If you create a new proposal, the old Tag Die ends.

**Refine the Offer:** For every two success points you spend, the Tag
Die of your existing proposal increases by one die size.

**Counter-Offer:** If the other party has a Tag Die, you can decrease
her die size by one step, or remove her Tag Die entirely if she has a
+1D6 Bonus Die. 

**Put It In Writing:** You get the other party to agree to sign a
written document after you close the deal.

**Reach Compromise:** You and the other party come to a compromise that
benefits you both equally, more or less, and you close the deal. All Tag
Dice created by either party immediately end.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Close the Deal:** You end the negotiation. Whatever you and the other
party have agreed upon is how it the terms will remain, and the other
party won't renegotiate terms in this scene. If you are haggling over a
purchase, you can use the Tag Die of your proposal as a Bonus Die on
your wealth roll; if the other party has a Tag Die, she can add that to
the opposition roll.

**Gain the Upper Hand:** You end the negotiation. You get what you were
hoping to gain without major concessions. The other party loses Tag Dice
she may have created during the negotiation.

### (section) Deceive

##### Guile Specialty

Deceive is the ability to tell a believable lie, avoiding telltale
quirks and pitfalls that might reveal your duplicity. Lies which are
obviously untrue and unbelievable impose a penalty of Drop 1 to Drop 4,
at the MJ's discretion.

**Language:** If you and the other parties don't share a common
language, you gain a Drop 4 penalty on all Interaction rolls.

**Time:** Deception rolls are made after each new, major claim is made,
so could occur after 30 seconds of rambling, or hours of prolonged
storytelling.

**Knowledge Rolls:** This Specialty is not often used to make knowledge
rolls.

**Crafting:** An alternate identity or a simple disguise, as described
in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Use the Intuition specialty of each person who is
listening to the lies.

###### (success table) Deceive

**++:** Appear Sincere

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Appear Trustworthy

(end success table)

**Think on Your Feet:** You come up with something quickly so that you
don't look like you're obviously making something up. You can create a
+1D0 Tag Die based on your lie that you can use as a Bonus Die on
appropriate rolls until the end of the scene. Attempts by others to
disprove your lie, through logical deduction or knowledge rolls, are
made against Easy (3D6) standard opposition.

**Appear Sincere:** You lie while giving the impression that you really
do believe what you're saying. For every two success points you spend,
the Tag Die of your lie increases by one die size and the difficulty of
disproving the lie increases by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Appear Trustworthy:** Even if your lie is later exposed as false,
those who heard it still believe you that you didn't intend to deceive
them. Maybe you were mistaken, or they misheard you, or you misspoke.

## (subchapter) Magicks

The world of Elara has very subtle forms of magick: brewing draughts,
weaving charms into clothing, and reading portents. Most characters
completely lack knowledge in Magicks, leaving the study up to those who
specialize in it.

Successfully using a Magicks specialty results in the creation of a
Charm die. As with other types of dice, you can have only one Charm die
in any dice pool.

### (section) Weave

##### Verve Specialty

Charmwoven clothing must be specifically created for each character
using the Weave specialty, as it involves knowledge of the wearer's
birthstone and other personal qualities.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate charmwoven items and identify their
charms, determine the specific master charmweaver who created an item of
apparel, recall facts related to the creation of cloth and silk.

**Crafting: **Articles of clothing, including charmwoven apparel, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Most Weave rolls are made to craft garments. Sensing or
restoring a charm is Easy (3D6) standard opposition. An attempt to
suppress a or bolster a Charm Die is made against standard opposition
corresponding to the size of the Charm Die -- Easy (3D6) for a +1D6
Charm Die, Moderate (3D8) for a +1D8 Charm Die, and so on.

###### (success table) Weave

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**Item Die:** Tailoring Tools or Workshop

(end success table)

**Sense Charm: **You can sense charms woven into clothing that are in
the same area as you, starting with the nearest charm to you. You learn
the article of clothing that's encharmed and which Specialty the Charm
Die applies to. If you spend another success point, you also learn the
size of the Charm Die. For each additional success point you spend, you
can sense another charm in your area or an adjacent area. You can choose
to skip over any charm created or worn by you.

**Suppress Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is reduced by one
step. If it has a +1D6 Charm Die, you can remove it entirely. This
effect lasts until the end of the current scene. Each additional 2
success points you spend reduces the Charm Die by one step. You can
reduce a Charm Die as many steps as you have ranks in Magicks (Weave).

**Bolster Charm Die:** You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die, it is increased by
one step until the end of the scene. You can only increase a Charm Die
by one step.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Restore Charm Die: **You can choose one article of clothing in the
same area as you. If that article has a Charm Die that has been
suppressed or temporarily removed, you can restore the Charm Die to its
normal value. Until the end of the scene, that article's Charm Die can't
be suppressed.

### (section) Brew

##### Affinity Specialty

Brew is the magickal ability to distill enchantments into drinkable
draughts.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a draught and its effects, recall the
names of the master alchemists in a city, describe where exotic
ingredients can be found.

**Crafting: **Salves, draughts, and other alchemical formulations, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** Most Magicks (Brew) rolls are made to create a draught
or salve. Mixing a concoction has a standard difficulty of Easy (3D6). 

(success table) Brew

**Time:** 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**Item Die:** Alchemy tools or laboratory

**+:** Mix a Concoction

\++: Apply a Concoction

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

(end success table)

**Mix a Concoction:** You hastily mix together volatile chemicals and
reagents to produce an immediate reaction. You spend 1 unit of
alchemical ingredients and create one of the concoctions listed in
Chapter 9, "Specialty Equipment". The concoction has an initial potency
level of 1 but increases by 1 for every 2 success points you spend. The
concoction lasts until your next turn, after which it becomes inert.

**Apply a Concoction:** You apply the effects of your concoction to
yourself, your area, an adjacent area, or another person in the same
area as you. Each recipient of the effect beyond the first requires that
you spend 1 additional unit of alchemical ingredients, with a limit of
additional targets equal to your specialty ranks in Magicks (Brew).

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

### (section) Portents

##### Guile Specialty

The Portents specialty involves reading omens and signs as well as using
cards, dice, tea leaves, or astrological charts to determine someone's
future. It also includes placing hexes on people, and creating simple
trinkets known as bibelots that ward off hexes and bad luck.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Recall the names of famous seers or witches
throughout history, identify when someone is the target of a hex,
identify a bibelot's charm, remember the astrological signs and
birthstones.

**Crafting: **Astrological charts, bibelots, and divination tools, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Opposition:** If you read either the general omens around you or a
willing subject, the roll is an automatic success and the success points
determine the strength of the reading. If you are doing a reading on an
unwilling subject or if you are casting a hex on someone, the difficulty
is either Easy (3D6) or an opposed Magicks (Portents) roll, whichever is
better for the subject.

###### (success table) Portents

**Time:** 1 Minute

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**Item Die:** Divination tools, astrological charts

**+:** Read Portents

**++:** Increase Accuracy

**++:** Increase Precision

**++:** Increase Specificity

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Cast a Hex

(end success table)

**Read Portents:** You make a general prediction about the next 24
hours. Ask one yes-or-no question, or have the person you're reading ask
a yes-or-no question. You receive an answer which creates a +1D0 Tag Die
connected to that answer. Until the prediction comes true or 24 hours
passes, the subject of the reading can choose to use the tag as a Bonus
Die on any rolls that relate to the answer proving true. Each use of the
Tag Die decreases its size by one die size, or ends the prediction if
it's a +1D0 Bonus Die. As long as any prediction is still in effect, the
subject can't be the recipient of another reading.

**Increase Accuracy:** The Tag Die increases by one die size, with a
limit set by your ranks in Magicks (Portents) as shown in the following
table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Portents Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| \+1            | \+1D0           |
| \+2            | \+1D6           |
| \+3            | \+1D8           |
| \+4            | \+1D10          |
| \+5            | \+1D12          |

(end table)

**Increase Precision:** The duration of your prediction increases by 24
hours, up to a limit of increases equal to your Magicks (Portents)
ranks.

**Increase Specificity:** The subject of the reading can ask another
yes-or-no question and receive an answer, or ask a question that can be
answered with a single noun. This creates an additional +1D0 Tag Die
based on the new question, that otherwise functions like the first Tag
Die. The maximum number of additional questions is limited to the number
of Magicks (Portents) specialty ranks you have.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Cast a Hex:** You choose one skill and the subject of your reading
becomes cursed on rolls with that skill for the next 24 hours. If your
subject is wearing a bibelot for that skill, the hex immediately ends
and the bibelot is destroyed. Otherwise, any existing hexes on her end
and she gains a Drop 1 penalty on that skill and its specialties. Every
time the Drop penalty is applied to one of her rolls, it decreases by 1.
When the Drop penalty is reduced to 0, the hex ends. For every two
success points you spend, you can increase the initial size of the Drop
penalty by 1, with a limit determined by your ranks in Portents as shown
on the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Hex Penalty

|                |                     |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Portents Ranks | Maximum Hex Penalty |
| \+1            | Drop 1              |
| \+2            | Drop 2              |
| \+3            | Drop 3              |
| \+4            | Drop 4              |
| \+5            | Drop 4              |

disease, determine the cause of an injury, recall facts about a known
illness and useful folk cures for the same.

**Crafting:** Cures for diseases and other medical supplies, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Base Time:** Treating a wound or removing Yield takes one minute, and
treating diseases or applying cures takes one hour.

**Extra Supplies: **You can use extra medicine during treatment to add a
Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your
number of ranks in Medicine (Surgery), as shown on the following tables:

###### (table) Extra Supplies

|                   |           |                         |

(end table)

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to treat a patient by taking a Drop
penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking extra
time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
treatment, as shown on the following tables:

###### (table) Rushing a One-Minute Task

|                 |              |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |

| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

(end table)

###### (table) Rushing a One-Hour Task

| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

(end table)

**Opposition:** The opposition depends on the severity of the condition
being treated. Reducing Yield is an automatic success, with the number
of success points determining how many points of Yield are removed.
Treating wounds is Easy (3D6), and treating a disease is dependent upon
the severity of the disease.

###### (success table) Treat

**Time:** 1 minute or 1 hour

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**Item Die:** Chirurgeon's Knives or Surgical Theatre

**+:** Reduce Patient's Yield

**++:** Heal 1 Wound

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Reduce Disease Severity

(end success table)

**Reduce Patient's Yield:** If someone in the same area as you has taken
Yield, you can remove one point of Yield per success point you spend.
This expends one unit of medicine, regardless of how many success points
you spend.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Heal 1 Wound:** The patient heals one Wound that has been sustained in
the last hour. This consumes one unit of medicine for each Wound healed,
and requires one minute of time.

**Reduce Disease Severity:** The severity of the disease decreases by
one step, or is eliminated if the disease is already of the weakest
severity. This consumes one unit of medicine for each severity level
decreased. 

### (section) Poison

##### Guile Specialty

The Poison specialty covers the creation, application, and use of
various toxic substances as well as antidotes for the same. A target can
be poisoned directly, or poison can be applied to a weapon.

poison. See the Equipment chapter for more details.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify a poison without being exposed to it,
diagnose someone suffering from poison based on the effects, determine
whether or not an item of food is safe to consume.

**Crafting:** Poisons and antidotes as described in Chapter 10,
"Crafting."

**Opposition:** Applying poison to your own weapon is an automatic
success, with the number of success points determining how many times
you can use that application of poison. Directly administering poison to
your victim is opposed by her Brawl roll. Adding poison to food or drink
is opposed by the highest Observation of whoever might be able to spot
you doing the deed. Administering an antidote is based on the potency of
the poison.

(success table) Poison

**Time:** 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard opposition

to a Knife, Sword, Polearm, or the arrows for a Bow. For each success
point you spend, you can use the poison's success table on one attack,
in addition to the normal success table for your weapon and attack. Your
weapon ceases to be poisoned when you make a number of attacks equal to
the success points you spent, when you apply a different poison to the
weapon, or at the end of the current scene.

**Poison Your Victim:** You can use your Success Points to directly
injure or debilitate the target by expending one dose of poison. Each
additional success point you spend can be used on the poison's success
table against your victim.

been poisoned, expending one dose of antidote. For every two success
points you spend, you can reduce the potency of the poison, reduce the
duration of the poison, remove 2 Yield inflicted by the poison, or heal
1 Wound inflicted by poison during the current scene.

**Avoid Notice:** You apply your poison surreptitiously, hoping to go
unseen. The opposition for an Observation roll to spot the poison --
either on your blade, in a drink, or in food -- is Easy (3D6). For every
two additional success points, you can increase the difficulty to spot
the posion by one step, limited by your specialty ranks in Medicine
(Poison) as shown in the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Observation Opposition

|             |                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Poison Rank | Item Die              |

you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

cannot Move or Run until she stands up; standing up is a Drop 1 combined
action.

**Disarm:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is wielding.
You get to choose if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in
an adjacent Area, or in your hand if you have one free.

Nature skill. Nature is a hands-on skill, learned through experience
rather than book learning.

### (section) Explore

##### Verve Specialty

The Explore specialty lets you navigate through the world, on land, sea,
or even in the air. When appropriate, you can also use Explore to search

becoming lost. The size of the Tag Die decreases by one step for every
two leagues you travel away from the landmark. For every additional 2
success points you spend the initial Tag Die increases by one step,
limited by your specialty ranks in Nature (Explore) as shown on the

**Opposition:** For gathering crops, farming, or butchery, the roll is
an automatic success and your success points are used to determine how
well you perform the task. Handling one of your own domesticated animals
is an automatic success as well.

The standard opposition for using handle animal with a wild animal or an
unfriendly domesticated animal is based the higher of its Instinct or
Ferocity attributes. Handling an animal with D6 Instinct is Easy (3D6),

tricks, go where you want it to go, or otherwise follow your directions.
With a wild animal, you can either make it flee or convince it to not
attack you and your companions until the end of the scene as long as you
don't approach it. If you're riding a horse, each Success Point you
spend allows you to clear one obstacle such as a fence, hedge, or
stream.

When you successfully use Handle Animal, you create a +1D0 one-word Tag
Die for the animal's attitude toward you that can be used as a Bonus Die
in Nature or Defense checks against that animal. The Tag Die lasts until
the end of the scene, and increases by one step for every 2 success
points you spend, up to a maximum based on your ranks in Husbandry as
shown in the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

An animal can provide a number of foodstuffs equal to its yield limit.
Farm animals provide an additional 50% more foodstuffs.

**Teach a New Trick:** You can teach a new trick to a domesticated

ranks of Husbandry, or is an old dog, you can't teach it any new tricks.
For a wild animal, domesticating it counts as one of its tricks.

### (section) Prowl

##### Guile Specialty

The Prowl specialty represents stealthy, secretive movement or action,
usually taken outdoors where there is sufficient cover or shadows to
hide from observers.

You make a Prowl roll as an action when you are not hidden and attempt
to do so, or as a free roll if you are already out of sight and someone
is looking for you. If you move from your location without moving
undetected, you must make another Prowl roll.

**Wounds:** Prowl rolls are subject to Drop penalties from your Wounds.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember old abandoned bandit hideouts, recall the
names of famous brigands.

**Opposition:** Hiding under optimal conditions (night, no moon,
inclement weather) is normally an automatic success. Such situations are
rare, however. Instead, most Prowl rolls are Easy (3D6) under ordinary
circumstances. Increase the standard difficulty by one step for each of
the following conditions: tracked by animals, bright sunlight, lack of
cover, quiet location.

###### (success table) Prowl

**Time:** 1 action

difficulty of Easy (3D6). For every two additional success points you
spend, you increase the difficulty by one step, limited by your ranks in
Nature (Prowl):

###### (table) Maximum Observation Opposition

|            |                       |

have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how

are automatically Competent with the Observation skill.

### (section) Perceive

##### Verve Specialty

With a Perceive roll, you can spot a person in a crowd, listen for one
voice in a chorus, notice the smell of burning wood, or detect an ambush
before it happens. The MJ can call for Perceive as a free roll, or you
can make additional rolls by using your action to examine your
surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Accurately describe someone you have seen or heard,
or identify her from a description.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Perceive roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for spotting someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll. Trying to Perceive something under difficult
circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded tavern, can have a
difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

###### (success table) Perceive

**Time:** Free Roll, or 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**+:** Notice the Obvious

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Notice Minor Detail

**+++++:** Notice Hidden Detail

(end success table)

**Notice the Obvious:** You notice something which is pretty easy to
spot but not directly in front of you, or you spot someone who is hiding
from you. For each additional success point, you spot something else
that isn't directly in front of you or hiding.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Notice Minor Detail:** You notice a small detail about a person, an
animal, an object, a vehicle, or an area that most people wouldn't
catch. For every 2 additional success points, you notice another detail
about the same thing.

**Notice Hidden Detail:** You make note of a tiny detail that someone
has taken pains to hide, disguise, or eliminate.

### (section) Intuition

##### Affinity Specialty

Intuition involves reading subtle cues from your environment, including
non-verbal cues from other people. The MJ can call for Intuition as a
free roll, or you can make additional rolls by using your action to
examine your surroundings.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember something that you didn't consciously
notice at the time you saw it, recall someone that you met in your
childhood.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, an Intuition roll is an
automatic success and the number of success points determines how well
you accomplished the task. The standard opposition for sensing someone
or something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to intuit something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

###### (success table) Intuition

**Time:** Free Roll, or 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**+:** Get a Hunch

**++:** Sense Danger

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Sense Falsehood

(end success table)

**Get a Hunch:** You have a gut feeling about something, and it's
probably right. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that can be used as a Bonus
Die on any Observation or Initiative rolls until the end of the scene.
The Tag Die is based on one word picked by the MJ. For each additional
success point, the MJ adds another word to the Tag. For every 2
additional success points, you increase the Tag Die by one step, with a
limit based on your ranks in Observation (Intuition) as shown by the
following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

|                 |                 |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Intuition Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| \+1             | \+1D0           |
| \+2             | \+1D6           |
| \+3             | \+1D8           |
| \+4             | \+1D10          |
| \+5             | \+1D12          |

(end table)

**Sense Danger:** You can identify one or more sources of immediate
danger that aren't readily apparent, including an ambush. Every two
Success Points you spend spots another potential source of harm.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sense Falsehood:** You can tell when someone is lying to you, picking
up on her unconscious tells. You don't know what the truth is, but you
do know you're not hearing it now. For the rest of the scene, you know
when she's telling you the truth and when she's not.

### (section) Deduce

##### Guile Specialty

The Deduce specialty lets you size up a situation and formulate a
scenario in which they make sense, as provided by the MJ. This will
always be a supplement to your own roleplaying and decision-making
processes while playing *The Queen's Cavaliers*; it is not meant to
substitute for player ingenuity. Deduce can also be used to analyze
clues and spot falsehoods.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember the solution to a puzzle you've solved
before, decipher a coded message, recall the names of famous detectives.

**Opposition: **Under most circumstances, a Deduce roll is an automatic
success and the number of success points determines how well you
accomplished the task. The standard opposition for detecting someone or
something hidden is determined by the hider's Nature (Prowl) or
Streetwise (Larceny) roll, and determining if someone is lying is
opposed by their Interaction (Deceive) roll. Trying to Deduce something
under difficult circumstances, such as inclement weather or a crowded
tavern, can have a difficulty of Easy (3D6) or more.

###### (success table) Deduce

**Time:** Free Roll, or 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**+:** Recognize Clue

**++:** Reach Simple Conclusion

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Infer Greater Plan

**+++++:** Reach Complex Conclusion

(end success table)

**Recognize Clue:** You realize that something in your current situation
is out of place or doesn't add up. You create a +1D0 Tag Die that you
can use on Observation and Streetwise rolls until the end of the current
scene. The MJ will tell you what the Tag is, but won't tell you what it
means. For 2 additional points you can increase the Tag Die by one step,
to a limit based on your ranks in Observation (Deduce) as shown on the
following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

|              |                 |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Deduce Ranks | Maximum Tag Die |
| \+1          | \+1D0           |
| \+2          | \+1D6           |
| \+3          | \+1D8           |
| \+4          | \+1D10          |
| \+5          | \+1D12          |

(end table)

**Reach Simple Conclusion:** You draw a basic conclusion from the
available facts. You need to have recognized at least one clue to reach
a conclusion. The conclusion will be simple and straightforward, a la
Ockham's razor, but is not guaranteed to be correct. Each time you find
another clue, you automatically know whether it fits your simple
conclusion or not.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Infer Greater Plan:** You can determine whether or not something was
deliberately done, and if so, become aware that there is more to the
situation than what appears. If you witness more of this plan in action,
you will automatically know that it's part of the same scheme, even if
you don't yet know the role it plays.

**Reach Complex Conclusion:** You draw together several clues to form a
more complex scenario that fits the facts as you understand them. The
complex conclusion is guaranteed to be more accurate than a simple
conclusion, but it may not include all the variables and thus may be
subject to misunderstanding or inaccuracies. Each time you find another
clue or witness more of a plan, you automatically know how to include it
in your complex conclusion.

## (subchapter) Science

Science is a skill that covers the use, repair, and creation of advanced
technology and complex mathematics, from time watches to airships, from
repeating cannons to wing-gliders. The Blackpowder specialty also covers
the use of explosives.

### (section) Blackpowder

##### Verve Specialty

The Blackpowder specialty is used to work with explosives of all types,
as well as the rare phlogistone material that allows airships to soar
through the sky. Skilled powderworkers are employed by militaries, by
craftsmen, and by airship crews.

A Blackpowder roll is used to fire cannons and throw grenades, which
cause explosive damage to all within a given Area or to structures such
as buildings or ships. Although pistols and muskets use blackpowder to
fire their ammunition, the Military (Aim) skill is used for those
hand-held weapons.

**Explosion Damage:** An explosion weapon does damage to everything
inside a given Area. More powerful explosions also do damage in adjacent
Areas, and even targets up to two Areas away for the most powerful
explosions.

The person who initiated the explosion makes a Blackpowder roll as an
automatic success to set the base damage and the range.

Anyone in an area affected by the explosion makes a Block or Dodge roll
that also is an automatic success. For one success point on the Block or
Dodge roll, a target gains one less point of Yield, and for three
successes she takes one less Wound.

###### (success table) Block or Dodge (Explosion)

**Time:** Free roll

**Opposition:** Automatic success

**Item Die:** Armor die or Shield die for Block rolls

**+:** Take 1 Less Yield

**+++:** Take 1 Less Wound

**+++: **Gain 1 Style Point

(end success table)

**Knowledge Rolls:** Evaluate the quality of a cannon or grenade,
describe the process used to create blackpowder or phlogistone,
remember, remember the 5th of Frimaire.

**Crafting:** Phlogistone furnaces, cannons, grenades, fireworks, and
other uses of blackpowder.

**Wounds: **Blackpower rolls with explosive weapons are subject to Drop
penalties from your Wounds.

**Time:** Firing a loaded weapon or detonating charges takes one action.
Setting or disarming explosives takes one minute. 

**Item Die:** Add the Weapon Die as an Item Die when using an explosive
weapon, or the Item Die of repair tools if setting, disarming, or
detonating explosives.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time setting or disarming a bomb to
add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by
your number of ranks in Science (Blackpowder), as shown on the following
table:

###### (table) Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

|                 |           |                           |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Blackpowder Rank Required |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                       |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       | \+2                       |
| 15 minutes      | 1D8       | \+3                       |
| 1 hour          | 1D10      | \+4                       |
| 4 hours         | 1D12      | \+5                       |

(end table)

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to set or disarm a bomb by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the task, as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Rushing a One-Minute Task

|                 |              |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

(end table)

**Opposition:** When using an explosive weapon or detonating charges,
the Blackpowder roll is an automatic success and the success points are
used to select a target area and set the base damage of the explosion.
For setting or disarming explosives, the standard opposition is based on
the bomb's Explosion Dice.

###### (success table) Blackpowder

**Time:** 1 action, or 1 minute

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**Item Die:** Weapon die or repair tools

**Bonus Die:** Extra time

\+: Hit An Area

\++: Base Damage +1 Wound

**++:** Set Timed Fuse

**++:** Detonate Charges

**+++:** Expand Radius

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**++++:** Disarm Explosives

(end success table)

**Hit An Area:** You fire an explosive weapon into an area adjacent to
your own. For each additional success point you spend, you can move the
center of the explosion another area away from you, out to the maximum
range of the weapon.

**Base Damage +1 Wound:** For every two success points you spend,
increase the base damage by 1 Wound. This increase to the Wound damage
is limited to twice the number of ranks you have in Science
(Blackpowder).

**Set Timed Fuse:** You set a timed fuse in your area to detonate within
a given period of time. The default fuse for a standard bomb is one to
10 rounds, with the exact number of rounds being up to you. The bomb
detonates at the end of the chosen round, after everyone else has acted.

**Detonate Charges:** You immediately detonate a bomb in your own area
or an adjacent area. Alternately, you can use a Pistol or Musket within
its normal range or a thrown flame within Short range (1 to 2 Areas) to
perform this action. Add the Pistol or Musket's Weapon Die as an Item
Die, and apply any Drop Penalties due to the weapon's normal range.

**Expand Radius: **When setting explosives or firing artillery, you can
extend the radius of the blast by one step. "Close" becomes "Adjacent",
"Adjacent" becomes "Short", and so on, out to the maximum radius of the
explosives.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Disarm Explosives:** You disarm a bomb or other explosive device that
has not yet detonated.

### (section) Clockworks

##### Affinity Specialty

The Clockworks specialty allows you to create, repair, and customize
clockwork devices. For more details, see the list of clockwork devices
and components in Chapter 9, "Specialty Equipment."

**Knowledge Rolls:** Identify the functions and components of a
clockwork device, recall the names of famous mechanicians, determine
what components of a device are malfunctioning, read and understand
plans drawn by other clockworkers.

**Crafting: **Clockwork devices, components, power sources, and other
mechanical contrivances, as described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

power from it. Sabotaging a device takes 1 minute. To repair a device or
salvage components from it takes 1 hour.

**Bonus Die:** If you have plans for the device you're working on, you
can add the bonus die from those plans to the roll, in addition to any
applicable Item Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time repairing, salving, or
sabotaging a device to add a Bonus Die to your dice pool. The size of
that die is limited by your number of ranks in Science (Clockworks), as
shown on the following tables:

###### (table) Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

|                 |           |                          |

| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                      |

(end table)

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to repair, salvage, or sabotage a
device by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job
that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends
on how much you rush the task, as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Rushing a One-Minute Task

**Keep It Together:** You manage to patch the device together long
enough that one malfunction doesn't affect it until the end of the next
round. For each additional success point, you increase the duration by
another round.

**We Need More Power: **You manage to coax an extra point of power out
of a device's power source for every two success points you spend, with
a limit of extra power equal to your ranks in Science (Clockworks). The
increased power lasts until you spend it or the end of the next round.
At the end of the scene, the device gains one malfunction for every time
you boosted the power output.

**Repair 1 Malfunction:** You fix the device and remove a malfunction in
one of its components. Each malfunction removed requires the expenditure
of one unit of supplies of a type used to create the component.

**Salvage a Component:** You can remove one functioning component or
power source from the device, for use in later devices; this requires at
least an hour's worth of work. You can't salvage a malfunctioning or
destroyed component. Alternately, you can destroy a component or power
source to regain one unit of supplies of a type used to create the
component.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Sabotage Machine:** You add a malfunction to one component in a
device. If you spend an extra success point, you can remove the
malfunction later by taking a single action to do so.

### (section) Calculus

**Analytics:** You create a +1D0 Tag Die based one specialty that can be
used as a Bonus Die until the end of the scene. The Tag Die can only be
used in a roll that uses quantities, measurements, prices, or other
numbers. Examples include navigating with Nature (Explore), cooking food
with Nature (Husbandry), haggling over a price with Interaction
(Negotiate), or aiming a cannon with Science (Blackpowder). For every
two additional success points you spend, you can increase the Tag Die by
one size, with a limit based on your ranks in Science (Calculus) as
shown in the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

The Banter specialty lets you toss quips and insults both in and out of
a fight, trying to provoke a reaction of some kind. You can use Banter
to demoralize your foes or impress your audience.

**Language:** You can only use Banter on someone who can understand the
language you're speaking.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Remember embarrassing details about someone else's
personal life, recall a scathing retort from a line of a play.

**Time: **Most uses of Banter take only 1 action to perform, although
spreading rumors takes 1 hour.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time spreading rumors to add a Bonus

**Decrease Advantage:** If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease
her die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she
has D6 Advantage.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every three
Success Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her
Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Spread Rumor:** You spread scurrilous yet believable lies about a
rival. You create a +1D0 Tag Die based on a person, a place, an animal,
or an object involved in some scandalous way with your rival. You can
use the Tag Die as a Bonus Die on Interaction, Intuition, and Streetwise
rolls against your rival for 1 week (six days). The rumor can't be
easily traced back to you.

For one additional success point, you can extend the duration by one
day. For every 2 additional success points you spend, you can increase
the Tag Die by one step, to a maximum value based on your ranks in
Streetwise (Banter) as shown in the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Tag Die

will focus on you to the exclusion of other targets, until you're dead
or the fight ends.

### (section) Carouse

##### Affinity Specialty

The Carouse specialty involves frequenting establishments where liquor
is served and tongues accordingly flow more freely. Carousing in a
tavern or bar is a good way to pick up on the local rumors, and maybe
even learn some secrets from a drunken informant.

**Language:** If you don't speak one of the local languages, you get a
Drop 2 penalty on Carouse rolls.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Locate the best (or worst) taverns in town,
identify the type and origin of liquor with a taste, recall your
companion(s) in previous drunken trysts.

**Crafting:** Beer, ale, wine, and other alcoholic beverages, as
described in Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Item Die:** If you buy a round of drinks for everyone in a tavern, you
can add the highest die in its cost to your Carousing roll as an Item
Die.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time carousing to add a Bonus Die to
your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks
in Streetwise (Carousing), as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

|                   |           |                         |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Carousing Rank Required |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

(end table)

**Opposition:** The larger the city, the easier it is for you to get
information or make a connection without drawing too much attention to
yourself. In anything smaller than a large town, the standard opposition
is Hard (3D10). In a large town or small city, the opposition is
Moderate (3D8), and in a large city, the opposition is Easy (3D6). If
you go carousing in your usual haunts -- because sometimes you want to
go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came --
the roll is an automatic success and the success points are used to
determine how well you performed the task.

two sources, but which still may or may not be true.

be that an old soldier telling war stories, a romantic partner of a
gender of your choice, or a friendly bartender to hear your tale of woe.
You can locate them easily and enjoy their company another night for the
next week (6 days), and can increase that duration by one week for each

### (section) Larceny

##### Guile Specialty

The Larceny specialty is used for criminal endeavors, primarily theft.
You use Larceny rolls not only to steal objects but also fence them and
to purchase stolen goods on the black market.

**Knowledge Rolls:** Estimate the value of a stolen object, evaluate the
quality of a lock or door, recall the names and rap sheets of famous
criminals.

**Crafting:** Locks, traps, alarms, and forgeries, as described in
Chapter 10, "Crafting."

**Rushing: **You can reduce the time to perform a Larceny roll by taking
a Drop penalty on your die roll. The size of the Drop penalty depends on
how quickly you rush, as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Rushing a One-Minute Task

|                 |              |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

(end table)

**Opposition:** For poor traps, alarms, and locks, use Easy (3D6). For
average obstacles, use Moderate (3D8). For high-quality obstacles, use
Difficult (3D10). For extremely complex obstacles, use Very Difficult
(3D12).

**Opposition:** When trying to steal something, use the highest
Observation specialty of whomever might see you.

###### (success table) Larceny

**Time:** 1 minute

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition or Observation

**Item Die: **Repair tools when working with obstacles

**+:** Case the Joint

**++:** Steal Something

\+++: Bypass Obstacle

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

\+++: Install Obstacle

(end success table)

**Case the Joint:** You look around your own Area or an adjacent Area
and learn one of the following pieces of information:

• The nearest exit, and whether it's locked

• The most valuable object you could carry, and whether it's unsecured

• The location of the nearest guard or other observer

• The location and trigger of a trap or alarm

Each additional Success Point you spend can tell you a different piece
of information, or the next item down within the same category. For
example, a second Success Point could tell you the second nearest exist,
the second-most valuable object, the location of the second-nearest
observer, or the location of an additional trap.

**Steal Something:** You can palm an unattended small item in your Area
without being seen. For an extra 2 success points, you can remove a
small item from the pocket of someone in the same Area as you. If you
spend an additional 2 success points, you can move it to your pocket or
the pocket of someone else in your Area.

**Bypass Obstacle:** You can pick a lock, bypass a trap, or disable an
alarm in your Area that would otherwise prevent you from engaging in
criminal activity. If you spend one additional success point, you can
reset the obstacle to become active again once you have left the Area. 

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Install Obstacle:** You can set a trap, alarm, or lock in your own
area to trigger once you have left the Area. An Easy (3D6) Observation
roll is required for someone to notice the trap. For each additional 2
success points you spend, the difficulty of the Observation roll
increases by one step, limited by the number of skill ranks you have in
Larceny as shown on the following table:

###### (table) Maximum Observation Opposition

|              |                       |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Larceny Rank | Item Die              |
| 1            | Easy (3D6)            |
| 2            | Moderate (3D8)        |
| 3            | Difficult (3D10)      |

| 5            | Very Difficult (3D12) |

## (subchapter) Generic Success Tables

The following Success Tables can be used in lieu of, or in addition to,
the specific Success Tables for each Specialty. The results should be
used loosely and with discretion, as some results might not be justified
based on the fictional context.

### (section) Non-Combat Skills in Combat

This table can be used to represent Skills which aren't normally
intended for a fight (i.e., not Defense, Dueling, Aim, or Brawl) but
which end up being used anyway. For example, a Mechanician might attempt
to overload one of her devices or a Virtuosa could sing loud enough to
shatter glass.

**Opposition:** The opposition dice can be anywhere from Easy (3D6) to
Very Difficult (3D12) depending on the MJ's assessment of the situation.
Alternately, the target can defend with an appropriate Defense
specialty, if the MJ decides the Skill use is similar to an attack.

###### (success table) Non-Combat Skills

**Time:** 1 action

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition or Applicable Defense

**++:** Inflict 1 Yield

**+++:** Reduce Yield Taken

**+++:** Increase Advantage

**+++:** Gain 1 Style Point

**+++++:** Inflict 1 Wound

(end success table)

**Inflict 1 Yield:** Your opponent takes one Yield for every two Success
Points you spend on Yield. If her Yield equals or exceeds her Yield
Limit, she is Yielded Out. 

**Reduce Yield Taken:** If you have taken Yield, you can reduce it by
spending three Success Points per point of Yield.

**Increase Advantage:** You gain a D6 Advantage Die if you don't already
have Advantage, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum
of D12.

**Gain 1 Style Point:** You gain one Style Point; you must describe how
you use the Specialty with style, and you can only have a maximum of
three Style Points at any time.

**Inflict 1 Wound:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more
Wounds than her Wound Limit (which is four for player characters, and
from one to four for non-player characters), she falls unconscious and
is dying.

### (section) Knowledge Rolls

Use this table for general knowledge rolls – for example, if a character
with ranks in Science (Clockworks) is trying to recall the name of a
famous Mechanician or a Chirurgeon is remembering the facts about a
disease. Each Specialty has one or more examples of knowledge rolls that
can be made with that Specialty, although the lists are not exhaustive.
MJs and players should be creative in how they use Specialties to make
knowledge rolls.

**Opposition:** Use Easy (3D6) in most circumstances.

###### (success table) Knowledge

**Time:** Free Roll

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition

**+:** Recall Common Knowledge

**++:** Recall Uncommon Knowledge

**++++:** Recall Rare Knowledge

**+++++:** Recall Unique Knowledge

(end success table)

**Recall Common Knowledge:** You can recall basic facts about the topic,
enough to hold a simple conversation about it.

**Recall Uncommon Knowledge:** You are aware of some things that aren't
common knowledge about the subject.

**Recall Rare Knowledge:** You know something about the subject that
only comes from deeper study or experience.

**Recall Unique Knowledge:** You have firsthand knowledge of something
about the topic that only a few others share.

### (section) Standard Opposition Results

These results can be used by the MJ when a player's roll against
Standard Opposition dice fails. As with other generic result tables,
these should be used with discretion, as not all results will fit the
fictional circumstances.

**Opposition:** Standard Opposition is only rolled in response to an
action taken by a player character. If the Standard Opposition roll
beats the action's roll, the MJ may spend the Success Points on this
table, as well as declaring the action invalidated.

###### (success table) Standard Opposition

**Time:** Free Roll

**Opposition:** Specific Specialty Used

**+:** Increase Difficulty

**++:** Inflict 1 Yield

**++:** Increase Tension

**++:** Mysterious Omen

**++:** Delayed Gratification

**+++:** Grant 1 Style Point

**+++:** Rude Interruption

**++++:** Unnecessary Distraction

**++++:** Challenge a Passion

**+++++:** Incredibly Bad Fortune

(end success table)

**Increase Difficulty:** Step up one of the dice used in the roll, if
the player character (or an ally) attempts the same task. For example,
if the Standard Difficulty was Moderate (3D8), with one Success Point
you could step up one die, making it 1D10+2D8 on subsequent attempts. If
you spend three Success Points, step up all three of the dice.

**Inflict 1 Yield:** If the player character is attempting something
physically, mentally, or emotionally taxing, you can choose to inflict
Yield on her. Each additional two Success Points inflicts an extra point
of Yield.

**Increase Tension:** You gain a D6 Tension Die if you don't already
have Tension, or increase your die size by one step, up to a maximum of
D12. Describe how the tension in the current situation increases based
on the player character's failure at the task.

**Mysterious Omen:** Something ominous happens, perhaps foreshadowing a
future event. Players can attempt a Portents roll if they wish to try to
interpret the omen.

**Delayed Gratification:** The player character (or an ally) cannot make
another attempt at the same task until a certain amount of time has
passed. If the task normally takes one round, she must wait for a
minute; if a minute, then for an hour; if an hour, then for four hours;
if four hours, then for a day.

**Grant 1 Style Point:** Assign a Style Point to one of your non-player
characters, usually a Minor or Major Opponent. Minor Opponents can have
up to three Style Points, Major Opponents can have up to six Style
Points, and other characters can have only one Style Point.

**Rude Interruption:** The player character fails to complete her task
because someone rudely barges in, interrupting her. Choose one of your
existing NPCs or create a new character to intrude on the character;
this could even be a hostile opponent, although not a Major Opponent.
She won't be able to resume her task until she manages to send away the
intruder.

**Unnecessary Distraction:** An event happens nearby that distracts the
player character, causing her to fail on her attempt. This could be a
loud noise outside, a sudden wind blowing around some papers, a horse
that decides to bolt, or an attractive person passing by. If the player
character (or an ally) attempts the task again, she gets a Drop 2
penalty on the roll.

**Challenge a Passion:** Choose one of the player character's Passions,
and a way in which it becomes challenged. Perhaps the Personification of
the Passion appears (as an NPC), or the player character remembers
something about that Personification (if not able to appear in person).
Maybe the situation changes so that the player character has to choose
between her values and succeeding at the task. Be creative\! The game
result is that if the player character attempts the task again, add her
Passion Die to the Standard Opposition dice on subsequent tries.

**Incredibly Bad Fortune:** Something goes disastrously wrong. A ship at
sea gets lost, a device being created explodes, a gun misfires, the
guards show up at the wrong moment, or the player character trips and
falls in front of an audience. The exact details are up to you, but they
should be serious without being directly deadly and possibly very
embarrassing. The player character can attempt the task again one she
recovers from the effects of her terrible luck.
