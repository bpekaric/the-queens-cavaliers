### Explore

You can craft maps, globes, rations, shelters, rafts, and other survival gear with the Nature (Explore) specialty.

**Base Time:** Crafting a quick map or rations takes 1 hour. Crafting survival gear creation takes 1 day.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your tools or workroom to your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Supplies are required for crafting with this Specialty.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Nature (Explore).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft by taking a Drop penalty
on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking extra time on.
The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.
