### Tag Dice

As described in Chapter 4, "Skills & Specialties", Tag Dice are a type
of Bonus Dice that are tied to a specific concept. This could be a
single word, an emotion, a Passion, a phrase, or other abstract
constructions. The crafting description for each Specialty describes how
each Tag is created, what you can associate each Tag with, and how you
can increase the Bonus Die size of the Tag.

For example, if you create a painting of Bentheim Castle as seen from a
grassy meadow, you could assign a Tag of "Peaceful." The Tag Die starts
at +1D0, and for every 2 success points, you can increase the size of
that die. You can also use success points to add a different Tag, such
as "Loyalty." These additional dice also start at +1D0.

The Tag Die can be added to a dice pool as a Bonus Die whenever it makes
sense in the story -- so if you're trying to calm down a visiting
dignitary, you might seat her under the painting and add the Peaceful
tag to your Interaction (Negotiate) dice pool. Alternately, if you're
trying to inspire the soldiers of Bentheim Castle to stand firm and not
desert in the face of the enemy, you may want to make your Interaction
(Inspire) roll when you stand in front of the painting of the castle.
