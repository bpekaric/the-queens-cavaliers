# Crafting

As described in Chapter 4, "Skills & Specialties," characters in *The
Queen's Cavaliers* can use most specialties in order to craft items
related to that specialty. The requirements for crafting are:

  - **You need to spend time.** The time varies -- minutes, hours, days,
    weeks. You can't craft more than 8 hours in a day. (Lutetia's unions
    are quite strong.) You may be able to increase or decrease the time
    to craft an item, to affect your success at crafting.
  - **You need tools to work.** If you don't have the right tools, you
    at least need something that can function as the right tools, even
    if you don't get an Item Die from the makeshift tool.
  - **You need at least one specialty rank.** You can't make a crafting
    roll based on the skill alone. Each further specialty rank adds new
    items you can craft.
  - **You need to expend supplies.** Supplies are counted in "units", an
    abstracted measure of the raw material you have on hand. In most
    cases, you can't substitute something else, but check with your MJ.
  - **You need to make a specialty roll.** If you've met all the other
    requirements listed above, you automatically succeed on the roll and
    craft something. The purpose of the roll is to determine how well of
    a job you did on the crafting. The more success points you spend,
    the better the final product. You can't gain style points on
    crafting rolls.

### Supplies

The raw materials used in crafting are known as "supplies". Supplies are
measured in terms of "units" -- each unit of supplies is an abstract
amount of the materials for making the simplest item of a given type.

Supplies can be purchased as shown in the following table. All supplies
can be bought in bulk, as described in Chapter 7, "Wealth
Rolls."

###### Supplies

| Item                   | Cost | Use                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemical ingredients | 1D6  | Draughts, salves, concoctions, poison, medicine |
| Art media              | 1D6  | Works of art                                    |
| Blackpowder charges    | 1D0  | Blackpowder weapons, phlogistone components     |
| Clockwork gears        | 1D6  | Clockwork devices and components                |
| Crucible steel         | 1D6  | Weapons, armor, clockwork gears, casings        |
| Fabric                 | 1D0  | Charmweaving                                    |
| Foodstuffs             | 1D0  | Cooking, eating                                 |
| Medicine               | 1D6  | Surgery, treat                                  |
| Writing materials      | 1D0  | Reports, written works of art, battle plans     |

**Alchemical ingredients:** Chemicals, herbs, rare salts, parts of
animals, and other materials used to create salves, draughts, poison,
and medicine.

**Art media:** Supplies for creating works of art, ranging from canvas
and paints to sculpturing clay and marble blocks.

**Blackpowder charges:** Units of blackpowder that can create explosive
weapons or be purified to produce phlogistone.

**Clockwork gears:** The parts needed to create clockwork components
that are then assembled into clockwork devices.

**Crucible steel:** Worked metal that can used to make weapons, armor,
clockwork gears, and more.

**Fabric:** Cloth, lace, thread, silk, dyes, leather, buttons, and other
materials for making clothing.

**Foodstuffs:** Grains, fruit, meat, cheeses, sugar, eggs, bread, and
other materials for cooking. One unit of uncrafted foodstuffs is enough
to feed one person for one day.

**Medicine:** Medicine, medicinal herbs, and other medical supplies used
to treat injuries, cure diseases, create antidotes, and perform surgery.

**Writing materials:** Paper and ink, used in creating reports, plans,
and written works of art.

##### Scrounging

If you have neither the necessary supplies on hand nor the ability to
purchase more, you can spend your time scrounging -- looking in refuse
bins for art supplies, junk piles for crucible steel, discarded
trimmings for fabric, or roadkill and old fruit for foodstuffs. Every
two hours spent scrounging produces one unit of supplies -- as long as
your MJ agrees there are such supplies to be found. If you're lost in
the middle of a frozen tundra, you probably can't find blackpowder
charges just waiting for you to come along.

### Workrooms

Basic sets of handheld tools are described in Chapter 8, "Equipment,"
and can be used as an Item Die on appropriate crafting rolls.

However, most serious crafting work is done in some kind of dedicated
room or outbuilding. Such workrooms have everything you'd find in a set
of tools, plus additional equipment, furniture, and resources for each
task. These workrooms can provide an Item Die, as shown on the following
table. As you can only have one Item Die per dice pool, you can't
combine the Item Die from a set of tools with the Item Die from a
workroom.

###### Workrooms

| Room            | Cost | Item Die |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- |
| Artist's Studio | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Kitchen         | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Laboratory      | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Library         | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Medical Theatre | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Observatory     | 2D10 | \+1D10   |
| Séance Room     | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Smithy          | 2D8  | \+1D8    |
| Workshop        | 2D10 | \+1D10   |

Most workrooms are only available in cities, although some smaller towns
might be able to provide an artist's studio, a kitchen, a séance room,
or a smithy. Setting up a workroom takes 8 hours of work, although that
can be done by either one person or divided among several.

Superior workrooms can be purchased for twice the listed cost and an
Item Die of one step higher. A superior kitchen costs 4D8 and gives a
+1D10 Item Die on rolls for cooking. Superior workrooms take 20 hours to
set up and can only be acquired in large cities.

### Extra Time

Taking your time to craft an item means you can check and re-check your
work at every step of the way, and the extra crafting time allows for
more careful work.

If the description of the crafting specialty has an "Extra Time" entry,
you can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die to your dice
pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in the
Specialty, as shown on the following tables:

###### Extra Time for a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 minutes       | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 5 minutes       | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 15 minutes      | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 1 hour          | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 4 hours         | 1D12      | \+5                     |

###### Extra Time for a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 hours           | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 4 hours           | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 8 hours (1 day)   | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 16 hours (2 days) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 32 hours (4 days) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

###### Extra Time for a One-Day Task

| Completion Time   | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2 days            | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 5 days (1 week)   | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 10 days (2 weeks) | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 20 days (4 weeks) | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 30 days (6 weeks) | 1D12      | \+5                     |

### Extra Supplies

Sometimes you can spend more supplies than you need in order to craft a
superior item. You could create a larger or more ornate version of an
item, or perhaps simply make several prototypes before eventually
getting it right.

If the crafting Specialty has an "Extra Supplies" entry, you can use
more materials than needed while crafting to add a Bonus Die to your
dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of ranks in
the Specialty, as shown on the following tables:

###### Extra Supplies

| Units of Supplies | Bonus Die | Specialty Rank Required |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 2                 | 1D0       | \+1                     |
| 3                 | 1D6       | \+2                     |
| 4                 | 1D8       | \+3                     |
| 6                 | 1D10      | \+4                     |
| 8                 | 1D12      | \+5                     |

### **(section) Rushing**

You don't always have the luxury of time when crafting. Perhaps there's
only 30 minutes until the brigands arrive and you still need to build
that net-flinging mechanical trap you've been planning out in your head.
In such a situation, you can rush your work to get it done in time.

If the crafting Specialty has a "Rushing" entry, you can reduce the time
to craft your creation by taking a Drop penalty on your die roll. You
can't rush a job that you're taking extra time on. The size of the Drop
penalty depends on how much you rush the crafting, as shown on the
following table:

Rushing also increases the opposition from an automatic success to Easy
(3D6). If you fail on a rushed crafting roll, you expend one unit of
resources as appropriate for your task

###### Rushing a One-Minute Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 45 seconds      | Drop 1       |
| 30 seconds      | Drop 2       |
| 2 actions       | Drop 3       |
| 1 action        | Drop 4       |

###### Rushing a One-Hour Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 30 minutes      | Drop 1       |
| 15 minutes      | Drop 2       |
| 5 minutes       | Drop 3       |
| 1 minute        | Drop 4       |

###### Rushing a One-Day Task

| Completion Time | Drop Penalty |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 6 Hours         | Drop 1       |
| 4 Hours         | Drop 2       |
| 2 Hours         | Drop 3       |
| 1 Hour          | Drop 4       |

### Success Limits

You must have at least one rank in a Specialty to use it in crafting.
However, a single specialty rank limits the quality of the item to a
basic work. The more specialty ranks you have, the higher potential you
can create.

Each Specialty's crafting description details the success limits for
crafted items. The maximum values for Item Dice, Charm Dice, Bonus Dice,
and the Standard Opposition (for attempts to escape or undo your
creation) are shown in the following table. The applicable columns of
the table are repeated with each Specialty's crafting
description.

###### Success Limits

| Specialty Rank | Item Die | Charm Die | Bonus Die | Standard Opposition   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| \+1            | \+1D6    | \+1D6     | \+1D0     | Easy (3D6)            |
| \+2            | \+1D8    | \+1D8     | \+1D6     | Moderate (3D8)        |
| \+3            | \+1D10   | \+1D10    | \+1D8     | Difficult (3D10)      |
| \+4            | \+1D12   | \+1D12    | \+1D10    | Very Difficult (3D12) |
| \+5            | \+1D12   | \+1D12    | \+1D12    | Very Difficult (3D12) |

##### Repairs

If you can create something, you can repair it as well. A damaged object
gains Malfunctions in the same way that a person gains Wounds. In terms
of game rolls, the object has a certain Drop penalty applied whenever
it's used -- Drop 1 for each Malfunction -- or one of its functions
simply stops operating.

The time to repair an object depends on the time it would take to create
a new one of the same type, as shown on the following table.

###### Repair Time

| Base Crafting Time | Repair Time |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1 minute           | 1 minute    |
| 1 hour             | 1 minute    |
| 1 day              | 1 hour      |

You can take extra time or rush the repair if you are able to do the
same when creating the item.

As with normal crafting rolls, you automatically succeed. Each success
point gained reduces the Drop penalty by one, or restores one function
to working order. For every complete set of three Malfunctions you
repair, you have to spend 1 unit of any type of supplies that would be
used to create such an item.

### Tag Dice

As described in Chapter 4, "Skills & Specialties", Tag Dice are a type
of Bonus Dice that are tied to a specific concept. This could be a
single word, an emotion, a Passion, a phrase, or other abstract
constructions. The crafting description for each Specialty describes how
each Tag is created, what you can associate each Tag with, and how you
can increase the Bonus Die size of the Tag.

For example, if you create a painting of Scanbreille Keep as seen from a
grassy meadow, you could assign a Tag of "Peaceful." The Tag Die starts
at +1D0, and for every 2 success points, you can increase the size of
that die. You can also use success points to add a different Tag, such
as "Loyalty." These additional dice also start at +1D0.

The Tag Die can be added to a dice pool as a Bonus Die whenever it makes
sense in the story -- so if you're trying to calm down a visiting
dignitary, you might seat her under the painting and add the Peaceful
tag to your Interaction (Negotiate) dice pool. Alternately, if you're
trying to inspire the soldiers of Scanbreille Keep to stand firm and not
desert in the face of the enemy, you may want to make your Interaction
(Inspire) roll when you stand in front of the painting of the iconic
castle.

### Weapon Qualities

When you craft a weapon, it's assumed to be a "stock" version of that
weapon as described in Chapter 8, "Equipment." If you want to add
something extra to a crafted weapon, you can add a Weapon Quality to
that weapon. Each specialty's crafting description lists which qualities
can be given to each type of weapon. The maximum number of Weapon
Qualities you can add to any given weapon equals your rank in the
crafting Specialty.

Rather than repeating the descriptions of Weapon Qualities in each
crafting specialty, they're listed here for easy reference. You can't
add the same Weapon Quality twice to a single weapon.

  - **Cavalry:** A weapon with the Cavalry quality must be used with
    your Main Hand. If you are using this weapon while riding a mount,
    you can substitute the mount's Item Die for your Weapon Die against
    an unmounted opponent.
  - **Defending:** You can use this weapon to make a Defense (Parry)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type
    of weapon usually can't be used for parrying.
  - **Double-Barreled:** You can fire twice, once per barrel, without
    reloading. If you choose to fire both barrels in the same shot, the
    Weapon Die increases by one step, but you take a Drop 1 penalty
    because it's harder to aim. Reloading each barrel separately gives
    the normal Drop penalty for the unaltered weapon, and reloading both
    barrels is a Drop 4 combined action.
  - **Extended Long Range:** The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at Long
    range. This can only be applied to weapons which can't normally be
    used at Long range, but which can be used at Medium range.
  - **Extended Medium Range:** The weapon gains a Drop 2 penalty at
    Medium range. This can only be applied to weapons which can't
    normally be used at Medium range.
  - **High-Caliber:** Increase the Weapon Die by one step. The Drop
    penalty for reloading the weapon increases by 1, and the Drop
    penalty at Long range increases by 2.
  - **Lightened:** Decrease the Weapon Die by one step. If the unaltered
    weapon could be used in your main hand, you can now use it in
    either. If the weapon required two hands to use, it can now be used
    with just the main hand. You can't lighten a weapon that's been
    weighted.
  - **Point Blank:** Decrease the Drop Penalty for Close range by 2.
  - **Quickloading:** Decrease the Drop Penalty for reloading this
    weapon by 1.
  - **Reach:** The weapon can be used to attack into an adjacent area as
    well as your own.
  - **Responding:** The weapon can be used to make a Dueling (Riposte)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though this type
    of weapon usually can't be used for riposting.
  - **Rifled:** Reduce the Drop Penalty at Medium range by 1 and at Long
    range by 1.
  - **Sparring:** You can use this weapon to make a Military (Brawl)
    roll and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even though weapons
    usually can't be used with Brawl.
  - **Success Table: Specialty (Option)** You add an option
    for spending success points to a specific Success Table. The details
    for each option are described later in this section.
  - **Throwable:** You can throw this weapon at a target using the
    Military (Aim) skill and add the Weapon Die to your dice pool, even
    though this type of weapon usually can't be thrown. The weapon has
    no Drop penalty at Close range, Drop 1 at Short range, and Drop 3 at
    Medium range.
  - **Weighted:** Increase the Weapon Die by one step. If the weapon
    could be used in either hand, it now is only usable in your main
    hand. If the unaltered weapon required your main hand, it now
    requires both hands. You can't weight a weapon that's been
    lightened.

#### Success Table Options

The Success Table: *Specialty* quality adds additional options to the
indicated success table.

| Success Table Weapon Qualities  |                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| \+                              |  Basket Hilt (Decrease Advantage) |
| \+                              |  Retort (Execute a Riposte)       |
| \+++                            |  Entangling                       |
| \+++                            |  Tripping (Knockdown)             |
| \+++                            |  Unhorse                          |
| \+++                            |  Wounding (Inflict 1 Wound)       |
| \+++                            |  Yielding (Inflict 4 Yield)       |
| \++++                           |  Disarming                        |
| \+++++                          |  Weapon-Breaking                  |

**Basket Hilt:** If your opponent has Advantage, you can decrease her
die size by one step, or remove her Advantage Die entirely if she has
+1D6 Advantage. Weapons with this quality are designed for parrying.

**Disarming:** You can disarm your opponent of the weapon she is using
to attack you or the weapon she's using to Parry your attack. (This
can't be used when defending against a Brawl attack.) You get to choose
if the weapon ends up on the ground in your Area, in an adjacent Area,
or in your hand if you have one free. Weapons with this quality are
designed for disarming opponents.

**Entangling:** You successfully catch your opponent with your weapon,
holding them in place. A combatant who is held suffers a Drop 1 penalty
on attack and defense rolls; for every two additional Success Points you
spend, you can increase the Drop penalty by 1, to a maximum of Drop 4.
Your opponent can escape by making a simple check against Standard
Opposition, usually using Brawl or a weapon attack.

**Retort:** You can make a Riposte attack. Weapons with this quality are
designed for parrying and allow a Riposte to be made for a lower cost
than usual.

**Tripping:** Your target is knocked prone, either in your Area or in an
adjacent Area. Knocking an opponent into an adjacent Area can result in
them falling or otherwise taking environmental damage. Weapons with this
quality are designed to pull an opponent off her feet.

**Unhorse:** If your target is riding a mount, they fall off that mount
and end up prone. Unhorsing an opponent can result in them falling or
otherwise taking environmental damage. In addition, your mount can make
a trample attack right now for free, if it has that quality. Standing up
is a Drop 1 combined action, and remounting is an additional Drop 3
penalty. Weapons with this quality are designed for dismounting
opponents.

**Weapon-Breaking:** You snap your target's blade or hilt. You can only
do this if your target attempts to Parry your attack and fails, or if
you are performing a Parry yourself. Weapons with this quality are
designed for catching and destroying weapons.

**Wounding:** Your opponent takes one Wound. If she takes more Wounds
than her Wound Limit, she falls unconscious and is dying. Weapons with
this quality allow you to inflict Wounds for a lower cost than usual.

**Yielding:** Your opponent takes four Yield. If her Yield equals or
exceeds her Yield Limit, she is Yielded Out. Weapons with this quality
allow you to inflict Yield for a lower cost than usual.

## Crafting Rolls

The following tables are sorted by Specialty name and describe what can
be crafted with each Specialty.

### Aim

You can craft bows, muskets, and pistols using the Military (Aim)
specialty.

**Prowess Required:** You can only create bows if you have Bow Prowess,
muskets if you have Musket Prowess, and pistols if you have Pistol
Prowess.

**Base Time:** Crafting a weapon takes 1 hour.

**Item Die:** Add the Item Die of your metalworking tools or smithy to
your dice pool.

**Supplies:** Supplies of crucible steel are required for creating
weapons.

**Extra Time:** You can spend extra time on crafting to add a Bonus Die
to your dice pool. The size of that die is limited by your number of
ranks in Military (Aim).

**Rushing:** You can reduce the time to craft your creation by taking a
Drop penalty on your die roll. You can't rush a job that you're taking
extra time on. The size of the Drop penalty depends on how much you rush
the crafting.

**Opposition:** Unless you are rushing, a crafting roll automatically
succeeds. The success points generated determine the quality of the
creation.

| Aim (Crafting) |                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Base Time      | 1 hour                     |

a Weapon Die of +1D6.

**Craft Heavy Pistol (2 units of crucible steel):** You create any
pistol with a Weapon die of +1D8 or higher.
