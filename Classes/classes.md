# Chapter 3: Classes

Your character in *The Queen's Cavaliers* is a composite of two classes.
Each class provides you with half of your starting skill competencies,
specialties, weapon and armor prowess, social rank, starting gear, and
style Maneuvers.

The various classes can be divided up into three basic categories:
skilled classes, social classes, and fighting classes. These are shown
on the following tables.

For the most well-rounded character, choose a fighting class and either
skilled or social class; that way, you'll be effective in a fight as
well as outside of one. Duelist is a good choice for a fighting class,
if you can't find another that doesn't really fit.

If you are mainly interested in creating things or helping people, you
can choose one skilled class and one social class, or two skilled
classes.

To make a mostly social character, choose a social class and a skilled
class, or two social classes.

Finally, if you want to build a character who excels at combat but not
at much else, choose two fighting classes.

You don't have to choose your classes if you don't feel inspired;
instead you can roll 1D8 for each one. Feel free to reroll if you don't
like your original results\!

## Class Descriptions

### The Duelist

A Duelist is a swashbuckling swordfighter who lives by her wits and her
skill at her blade. She may be a member of the Queen's Cavaliers, or a
rival organization, or may be a freelance fencer who runs her own
dueling school. Quite a few actors have been known to take up dueling as
well.

Duelist is appropriate to accompany any other class in *The Queen's
Cavalier.* As swordfighting is so prevalent in the game, the Duelist
class is a natural choice for most appropriate character concepts.
That's why they're presented out of alphabetical order here.

In other words, if you can't decide on a second class, choose Duelist.

are skilled at speaking before a magistrate.

Some Barristers work for the Crown and prosecute lawbreakers, while

### The Brigand 

While Gallinea and most of the Elaran continent are long-settled, that
doesn't always stop opportunists from engaging in banditry. The typical
Brigand in Gallinea is a peasant or even a minor noble whose fortunes
fell and they resorted to force of arms to make their living.

Not all Brigands are necessarily cruel; there's a long history of folk
heroes who rob from the corrupt rich and distribute their loot among the
poor.

### The Chaplain 

A Chaplain is a clergy member of an organized religion, usually Asrian.
The duties can vary but many times a Chaplain is found serving among
military members or as a member of the court. Chaplains have minimal
training in combat but are skilled at interacting with people.

Most Chaplains in Gallinea follow the Asrian faith, devoted to the
goddess-empress Eserre. Dodekan priests from Achalia are also found as
Chaplains, although rarely outside of the Achalian Islands. Devraist
priests are known as Speakers, and it's rare to meet a Devraist
Chaplain. Dualitarian Chaplains are sometimes co-classed as Speakers,
however.

### The Charlatan 

Charlatans are swindlers, confidence men, mountebanks, and other
tricksters who rely on their wits to defraud others. Many will hawk

called upon to heal battlefield injuries, such as musket wounds or
arrows to the knee.

Chirurgeons often wear black bird-headed Plague Masks when treating
their patients; many of these are charmwoven to improve their surgical
skills. Chirurgeons are not adverse to using magicks when appropriate,
including alchemical remedies.

separate yet equally important groups:**** the Constabulary, who
investigate crime, and the Crown Barristers who prosecute the offenders.
The Constables – and their counterparts in neighboring countries –
enforce the laws and protect the people from wrongdoers as well as
capturing those who commit criminal acts.

Most Constables are employed by the Crown or a local province, while a
few have retired and ply their trade as investigators for private hire.

### The Courtier

Members of the Gallinean royal court, and other noble courts, are
Courtiers. They are well-educated, trained in etiquette and social
graces, and have preternatural skill for plotting and intrigue.

Courtiers revel in their lives of luxury, but all know that they only
continue to have such glamorous lives at the forbearance of their
matrons and patrons. A Courtier who is outcast from polite society may
return to take revenge upon a noblewoman or nobleman.

Magicks and the sciences are a draw to the Courier, as well as some
martial pursuits; nobles often have time to develop such skills at their
leisure.

### The Dogsbody

A Dogsbody is a common manservant or henchperson, one who assists
another in their escapades and only rarely comes up with a cunning plan.

### The Provincial 

Outside of the cosmopolitan sprawl of Lutetia are the provinces of
Gallinea – home to commoners and petty noblefolk, many of whom lack
education and refinement. These Provincials – and the Provincials of
other nations – are looked down on by the city folk.

Provincials who come to Lutetia often feel they have something to prove
when dealing with residents of the capital city; it's not uncommon for
brawls to break out in bars because someone's clothes or horse was
insulted.

A few Provincials are minor nobles and choose the Courtier co-class,
although they rarely are afforded the respect given to their urban
cousins.

**Suggested Classes:** Brigand, Chaplain, Constable, Dogsbody, Dragoon,

### The Provocateur 

A revolutionary, a spy, an assassin, a traitor, a conspirator – these
are terms used to speak of the Provocateur, a shadowy figure enmeshed in
plots within plots. Provocateurs are used by all nations of Elara,
although they are rarely trusted even among those who employ them.

A typical Provocateur does not advertise her profession, so she will
usually rely on her co-class for her public persona. 

**Suggested Classes:** Charlatan, Courtier, Duelist, Envoy, Speaker,
Visionary

**Suggested Passions:** Church, Country, Love, Wealth

### The Speaker

A Speaker is an adherent of the Desert Mother, Devra, whose purpose in
Gallinea is to convert the masses. Devraism is legal within Gallinea but
is in conflict with the majority Asrian religion. For this reason,
Speakers usually keep a low profile while spreading their messages of
stoic living and opposition to secular authorities.

Few, if any, Speakers are loyal to the Gallinean crown; Speakers are
usually opponents for the Queen's Cavaliers rather than allies.

### The Veteran 

Gallinea and its neighbors maintain standing armies, composed of
professional soldiers who fight in their wars at home and abroad. The
most recent war between Gallinea and Albia lasted for a total of 20
years, ending 6 years ago with the marriage of then-princess Mariana
(now Queen Mariana) to prince Carolus of Albia.

Veterans of that and other wars are well-trained in the art of battle,
and if not currently part of a military unit, often join mercenary
companies or guard regiments rather than settle down into a civilian
lifestyle.

art, music, or drama. Virtuosas can be singers, actors, painters,
playwrights, sculptors, musicians, composers, poets, and other artists.

Being an effective Virtuosa requires training in the arts and history,

person. True Renaissance women and men, they are able to apply logic and
science ways that seem almost supernatural to many.

A Visionary may be a leader, or she may be a quiet follower who only
seeks to pursue her life's work. Visionaries are usually well-educated
and can speak confidently on a variety of topics.

### The Witch

An ancient tradition that predates the Qartan Empire, the Witches of
Gallinea are experts at folk remedies, herbal lore, midwifery, and
reading omens. Witchcraft is officially tolerated in Gallinea, although
most devoutly religious people eschew contact with Witches unless
absolutely necessary.

Some Witches are publicly known as such, but most keep their rituals
secret from the authorities, remembering past periods of persecution.

## Option: Random Backstories

This is an optional method of character creation that allows you to roll
randomly on a series of tables (or, with your MJ's permission, pick from
the lists) to determine your character's backstory, starting skills, and
proficiencies.

This system replaces the part of the character creation process where
you choose two classes.

When you gain a specialty, you also gain competency in the appropriate
skill. For example, if a result reads “Culture (Scholarship +1),” you
gain competency in the Culture skill if you didn't have it before, and
you gain one rank in the Scholarship specialty.

As a starting character, you are limited to a maximum of +2 ranks in any
specialty. If a random roll would increase your ranks to +3 or higher,
the additional points are added to your customizations which you can
spend later in the character creation process.

Because you don't have a class, you can't spend your customizations on
additional style maneuvers during the character creation process, apart
from national styles. (When you gain enough XP, you can take any style
maneuver later.)

### Example of Backstory-Based Character Creation

Dani decides to roll up a character using the optional random backstory
system instead of choosing two classes.

#### Regional or National Origin

Dani rolls a 12 on the table, meaning she's from Varendia. She adds the
Varendish language and the skills Military and Nature to her character
sheet.

#### Parentage

With a roll of 8, one of Dani's parents was a retired Cavalier. She adds
the Gallinean langague, skill competency in Dueling, one rank in Lunge,
prowess with swords, and the style maneuver Confident Fencing to her
character sheet. She also sets her D6 passion to Loyalty.

Dani also has to answer the question, “What notable deed did your parent
perform in the name of the Queen?” Dani decides that her mother stopped
an Albian airship from bombing Castenia during the Twenty Years' War.

#### Pivotal Event of Childhood

Rolling a d8, Dani gets a 1, and finds that someone in her family died.
She decides this was her father, and that his unexpected death caused
her to grow up quickly. She adds one rank to Intuition, and sets her D8
Passion to Family.

In answer to the question “What did your relative tell you before they
died?” Dani decides that her dying father told her to never turn her
back on someone in need.

#### Education

Dani rolls a result of 11 on the education table, meaning that she
attended the royal universities in Lutetia. This gives her the Gallinean
language, but she already speaks it. She also gains competency in
Culture; one skill rank each in Etiquette, Scholarship, Negotiate, and
Deduce; Knowledge as a D10 passion; and the Cunning Erudition style
maneuver.

To answer the question “Why did a stranger pay for your expensive
education?” she decides that the Duchess of Castenia paid for her
education in recognition of her mother's bravery during the last war.

#### Pivotal Event of Adulthood

Dani rolls a 1 on the final table, getting “Clandestinely Recruited.”
This gives her competency in Medicine and Streetwise, and one rank each
in Deceive, Prowl, Poison, and Carouse. She also gains Country as a D12
passion and Do You Expect Me To Talk? as a style maneuver.

“What have you learned that makes you mistrust your superiors?” Dani
distrusts her superior because she has been asked to spy on her fellow
members of the Queen's Cavaliers.

#### Backstory Summary

Dani was born in Varendia to a Gallinean mother and a Varendish father.
Her mother had distinguished herself during the war between Albia and
Gallinea, and when she had completed her duty to the Queen, she married
a man in Varendia and settled down. Tragically, Dani's father passed
away when she was young and she was raised by her mother.

Dani returned to Gallinea when she was old enough to study at the royal
universities in Lutetia, with her education paid for by a grateful noble
who remembered her mother's courage. Upon graduation, Dani was accepted
into the Queen's Cavaliers as a new recruit, and was also contacted by
Prince Jean-Remy, the Queen's uncle and spymaster, and asked to report
back to him on the actions of her fellow cavaliers.

**Languages:** Varendish, Gallinean

**Social Rank:** Soldier (D6), Artisan (D8)

**Weapon Prowess:** Knife, Sword

types of poisons)

#### Further Customization

Dani is now free to spend her customizations to further shape her
character to fit the concept she'd like to play. Dani can also spend her
starting Rewards on additional gear (plus gets a simple weapon for
free).

## Option: Creating a Custom Class

If only one of the classes appeals to you, you can create a custom class
with the MJ's consent. (Having two custom classes is not recommended;
choose one standard class in addition to your custom class.)

Make the following choices and write them down:

**Name and Description:** Decide what role the class will play in
Gallinean, Elaran, or Ifran society. How is this class different from
existing classes?

**Suggested Classes and Passions:** Choose at least 3 suggested classes
and passions that fit the class concept. **Limit:** You can't choose
Duelist as one of the classes.

**Social Rank:** If the class is primarily focused on combat, then the
Social Rank should be Soldier (D6). If the class requires formal
education or apprenticeship, then the Social Rank should be Artisan
(D8). Otherwise the class should probably be Commoner (D0). **Limit:** A
custom class can't be Noble (D10) or Royal (D12) social rank.

**Specialties and Skill Competency:** Choose six different specialties
that make sense for the class; these all gain +1. The Skill Competencies
correspond to those specialties, with the exception of skills that
everyone is already competent in using. **Limits:** Classes never give
specialty ranks in Initiative. Each attribute (Verve, Affinity, Guile)
can have at most 3 specialties associated with it.

**Weapon and Armor Prowess:** If the class would know how to use
specific weapons or armor types, pick up to four of those, total.
Remember that everyone already knows how to use a Knife.

**Bonus Gear:** Choose one outfit that the class will receive for free.
If the class requires the use of one or more tools, pick one of those
tools as well as 4 supplies of the appropriate type. If the class has
weapon or armor prowess, choose up one weapon and one type of armor.
Remember that everyone gets one common weapon for free.

**Style Maneuvers: **Choose six style maneuvers from the list of style
maneuvers that are appropriate for this class: two that allow a reroll
of one skill, two that allow one die to be maximized on a specialty
roll, and two that let you add dice from one pool to another under
specific circumstances.

When you've finished creating your class, let your MJ review it to see
if it fits her concept of the world and the campaign. She can provide
suggestions on how you can modify the class if she sees potential
problems with the class.

##### MJ-Created Classes

MJs, you can create classes too, and offer them as additional choices
for your players. You should try to follow the general guidelines given
for players, although you can customize the social rank, bonus gear,
armor prowess, and weapon prowess. You shouldn't give a class specialty
ranks in Initiative, and a class shouldn't have more than 8 style
maneuvers.

## Option: Playing Without Classes

You don't even have to play with classes (or backstories) at all. The MJ
might allow this option if she wants everyone to have the most
flexibility in creating their characters.

A base character starts with the following:

  - Skill Competency in Defense, Initiative, Interaction, and
    Observation.
  - One language.
  - Knife Weapon Prowess.
  - Social Rank of Commoner (D0)/Commoner (D0).
  - One outfit and one common weapon.
  - 30 customizations, replacing the 6 customizations that characters
    normally receive.

You can use those customizations in the following ways:

  - Add Competency in any one skill.
  - Add +1 rank to any Specialty which you have the related skill
    competency. Limits: You can't have more than +2 ranks in any given
    specialty. You can't assign more than eight ranks to the specialties
    corresponding to each attribute (Verge, Affinity, Guile).
  - Add one language.
  - Add one armor prowess or weapon prowess.
  - Increase one of your social ranks by 1, to a limit of Noble
    (D10)/Artisan (D8).
  - Add one style maneuver of your choice. Limits: You can have a
    maximum of six style maneuvers.

Once you have assigned your customizations, you receive four rewards
equal to your Competency Die, two rewards equal to your lowest rank, and
two rewards equal to your highest social rank. You can spend those
normally to buy your starting equipment.

### Example of Class-Free Character Creation

Morgan decides she's going to create a character who is all about
airships. She starts with the base character and then spends her 30
customizations.

**Skill Competency: **In addition to the automatic skill competency, she
also chooses to be competent with Dueling (for mid-air swordfights\!),
Military (for mid-air gun fights\! and airship tactics), Nature (so
she'll be good at exploring), and Science (since airships are pretty
advanced technology). This uses four of her customizations.

**Specialty Ranks: **Morgan picks Parry +1 (mid-air swordfights\!),
Dodge +1 (mid-air gun fights\!), Aim +1 (also mid-air gun fights\!),
Strategy +2 (airship tactics), Explore +2 (navigating), Blackpowder +1
(firing cannons\!), and Clockworks +2 (fixing a broken airship). She
also chooses Scholarship +1 (mainly for geographic knowledge), Etiquette
+1 (customs of far-off lands), Inspire +1 (officers should be inspiring,
right?) and Perceive +1 (for looking through a spyglass). Adding up the
totals for each attribute, she finds +6 ranks total for Verve (Parry,
Explore twice, Blackpowder, Inspire, Perceive), +4 ranks total for
Affinity (Aim, Etiquette, Clockworks twice), and +4 ranks for Guile
(Dodge, Strategy twice, Scholarship). This is under the limit of eight
ranks per attribute, so she's good there. This costs 14 of her
customizations.

**Languages:** Morgan decides she will be from Albia, and thus her free
language is Albian. She also gets a bonus language from her +1 rank in
Scholarship, and she picks Gallinean. She decides to also learn Ekalian
(because many sailors are from Ekalia) and Varendish (because the best
cannonsmiths hail from Varendia), and that uses up two more
customizations.

**Armor or Weapon Prowess:** While she doesn't think she needs armor
prowess, Morgan does want to know how to use Swords, Pistols, and
Cannons. She spends three customizations on those.

**Social Rank: **Figuring that airships are rather expensive to
maintain, Morgan pushes her social ranks up to the maximum of Noble
(D10)/Artisan (D8). This uses five of her customizations, and she's only
got two left from the original 30.

**Style Maneuvers: **Looking over the list of style maneuvers in Chapter
5, Morgan finds two that thinks will be most appropriate for a future
air-captain like herself. She selects Powdersmith (when creating or
repairing a device with a blackpowder flintlock power source, a
phlogistone furnace power source, or an explosion component, spend 1
Style Point to add Blackpowder dice to a Clockworks roll) and Naval Hilt
(when using a cutlass, spend 1 Style Point to add Explore dice to a
Parry roll). This uses up her last two customizations.

**Starting Equipment:** Naturally, Morgan starts with a corsair outfit,
and for her free weapon chooses a cutlass. She receives rewards of 4D6
(from her Competency Die), 2D8 (her Artisan social rank) and 1D10 (her
Noble social rank). It's not quite enough to buy an airship, so she
instead buys a cutlass (1D6 cost), a mariner's astrolabe (1D6 cost), a
spyglass (1D6 cost), repair tools (1D6 cost), a double pistol (1D8 cost)
because it's cool, and a deck cannon (1D10 cost) since she always wanted
a cannon. Doesn't everyone? This leaves her with a 1D8 reward, which she
chooses to spend on four supplies of clockwork gears so she can repair
an airship or make nifty toys.
